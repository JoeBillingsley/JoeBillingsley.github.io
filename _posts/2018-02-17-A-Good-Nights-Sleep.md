Jordan couldn't sleep.

There was no good reason for it. He tried sleeping on one side, then rolled to the other of his big empty bed. He flipped the pillows. He fluffed the pillows. He threw the pillows across the room. They stared at him from across the empty room and he stared back.

They won.

The pillows were neatly placed back on the bed before he flopped back on them once again. He couldn't get the blanket just right. He curled his legs till they were under the blanket. He kicked it down till it covered his toes. He pulled it up to his shoulders and it flew from out of his grasp to the corner of the room. It stared at his from across the empty room and he stared back.

Jordan couldn't sleep.
