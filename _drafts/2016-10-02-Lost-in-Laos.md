## Huay-Xai
### Welcome to Laos
The shabby tuk tuk's looked out of place amongst the decorative street lights and clean concrete pillars of the border control, Friendship Bridge 4. A smooth tarmac road winded through the wild hills, heading deeper into Laos. The price for a tuk tuk was extortionate but we didn't have time to wait for the bus and we could not afford to miss the ferry.

As soon as the border was out of sight the road began to fall apart quickly deterioating to a borderline dirt track littered with potholes. We soon came to the first of several bridges. Wooden slats were screwed haphazardly to an iron frame with two rows of planks nailed across in the other direction to bridge the gaps between the slats. The planks were placed just wide enough so that a single tuk tuk or two mopeds could cross it at a time - an ingenious design really since it looked like it might collapse under any more weight.

We turned off towards a town and the road gave up completely. Heading out were several vehicles I can best describe as drag-tractors with big bulky engines strapped to a wooden platform tugging along large trailers. We passed a hospital and I made a mental note not to get sick whilst we were in Laos. I was glad I remembered to take my anti-malaria pills the night before especially considering what we had planned. Our tuk-tuk dropped us off at the end of a more touristy road lined with colorful stalls selling snacks, fresh food and beer. Essentials for the long boat journey ahead.

### The (Very) Slow Boat to Luang Prabang
Your given a seat number when you buy a ticket but the actual seating is a scramble. Any locals get the best seats at the front of the boat. The remaining seats are allocated to distribute people fairly evenly over the boats that are meant to be leaving that day. Me and Sam managed to nab a good seat at the back of the boat in the habital zone near the toilet, but not too near. Others weren't so lucky and ended up stuck sitting in the aisles. Not ideal when your meant to be there for the next 8 hours.

The crew of the different boats shouted to each other as they used long poles to push themselves clear from the docks and from each other. The shouting communicated nothing to me - and maybe the crew were the same since it took a good 15 minutes of pushing and pulling with boats knocking and rolling into each other to get everyone out and onto the wide Mekong river.

Once there it is rather peaceful. The engine rumbles gently, the water stroking the side of the boat and the gentle ebb and flow of friendly conversation amongst strangers. Outside no space is wasted, life clinging on to every surface it can find. At times the shores is so dense with plants it would be impenetrable to all but the most determined whilst in the clearer spaces where the land is flatter you'll see signs of people who live off the river - cattle drinking by the river, kids playing in the sand, perhaps a small village.

After 4 hours of stunning scenery, and with no end in sight, I was thoroughly bored of looking out the window of a boat. Luckily the state owned brewery produces a surprisingly good beer (that's one point for communism) and after a few Beerlao's the hours just sailed by.

## Luang Prabang
### Arrival
Two days later, including a nights rest at a purpose built village halfway, we were finally approaching our destination. The boat stops at a makeshift dock just outside of town where tuk tuks wait to transport people the last mile.

The river itself winds all the way through Luang Prabang and we soon found ourselves walking along it as the sun started to set. It's a confusing place at times, full of winding roads and ever changing architecture. National and communist flags sway gently from the eaves of stern French colonial buildings. The regular measured designs of the European buildings in stark contrast to the flowing shapes of the many temples.

We eventually found a guesthouse halfway down a wide and winding alley. More traditionally it could have been a road but both sides of it were lined with stalls leaving only enough space for foot traffic. At this time of night the alley is full of food to meet any appetite whether you want something BBQ'd black or prefer your dinner still wriggling. Nestled under a small arch was a small mountain of food: bowls of rice the size of a car wheel, heaps of fresh BBQ'd meat, spicy sauces - and maybe some vegetables in there somewhere too. I didn't recognise half of what ended up on my plate but it all tasted excellent.

Looking to contribute to the local economy we set to exploring the nearby bars. First Utopia: a zen garden style bar, completely open to the elements and almost pitch black. Not a great place to drink too much in case you end up stumbling into the river. And after that: well that was almsot it actually. Turns out Laos is much stricter on it's curfew than Thailand so the bars have to shut pretty early. We ended up finishing the night in a bowling alley a little way out of town which just so happened to still be selling beer. It was surprisingly legitimate looking but that didn't stop some people and more than a few ended up in the gutter.

### Atovaquone/Proguanil
That night I dreamt of boats.

When I woke everyone else was still asleep. It was just me and the Laotion man standing next to my bed staring at me. His face, a foot from mine, bearing a massive grin.

Largely unconcious, I ignored him and went back to sleep.

The next morning I sat straight upright as I tried to understand what had happened. As it turns out one possible side effect of the antimalarials we were taking are vivid dreams even bordering on hallucinations. I had vivid dreams of boats every day I was in Laos but the strange man never reappeared.

## Same same but... 
The mad little alley near our hostel looked very different in the early morning. Most of the morning market had left or were leaving, carrying away exotic foods I hadn't even seen in the buffet and huge quantities of chilli.

Once you get your bearings the town for the most part consists of many fairly indistinguishable restaurants. That didn't really click until we sat down for lunch. The stalls were arranged in a horsehoe pattern with some tables shared in the centre. The owner of the nearest stall held held out a colourful menu to us listing a mix of French crepes, baguettes and smoothies. The next stall also had a menu listing... an identical mix of French crepes, baguettes and smoothies only on different colour paper. Past the menu each stall was identical organised. Two man teams, well usually a man and a woman, with one taking orders and the other making sandwiches behind. Alternatingly decorated with fizzy drink cans or bowels of fruit.

The same thing appears throughout the whole town. All the bars have the same Beerlao branded signs, crates, placemats, table clothes... At night the hundreds of brightly lit stalls stretching down the high street somehow all sell the same five things. If you ever find yourself with a pressing need for hundreds of beerlao t-shirts or overpriced rugs or otherwise fancy a cutlerly set made entirely of exploded ordnance then you need to visit the Luang Prabang night market. Otherwise, give it a miss.

I'm not sure what could have caused this phenomenon. There's certainly some pressure from the communist government, it's too organised for anything else but there still needs to have been some cultural pressure to start things off and to have kept it goings. To take a wild guess I'd say it's a result of a culture not used to competition. If everyone works together then no one needs to work as hard, especially when things are already tough. The downside being that new approaches are penalised. If it goes well you may face resentment for your success. If it goes poorly the community must support you. Anyone who tries to stand out, stands alone.

The internet did point us to some cool places further afield like a restaurant in the back of an expats garden we had the best pizza I think I've ever had, which like the burger from Bangkok, says something about the quality of cooking in the west or perhaps in the east. And there are some objectively beautiful parts of town but architecture doesn't really do anything for me. Some 'early' mornings (09:00) whilst smart people slept off their hangovers I roamed about town myself but I never could find much of interest. Only more of the same, better hidden. As it turns out there is a reason why some paths are well trodden.

The only advantage of the facade being so thin is that you can see that there is more going on if you care to look. Very late at night when most the tourists have long been sleeping, people work to prepare the city for the next day. Women on the night market pack up their wares into wheelbarrows and head off to somewhere far away in the night. A truck quietly rolls down our alley whilst workers pick rubbish off the street with their bare hands. There are stories to find here if you have the time but in a scant few days we were moving on.

## Route 13
There are two ways to get from Luang Prabang to Vang Vieng. A minibus that goes directly to Vang Vieng winding over the mountain in between and a conventional bus that is too large to climb the mountain and works its way around. We'd been warned before that the minibus route although quicker, was far more dangerous. The road over the mountain winds sharply and steeply. Much of the road is unfinished and most of what has been completed had cracked and slipped leading to 1/2 metre drops along the road to navigate. Unfortunately I stopped listening at 'quicker'.

Littering the road were others failed efforts at the climb. We turned one corner and saw an overturned car that had somehow rolled down the steep road and luckily came to a rest at a safe corner. A woman nearby stared bewildered at us as we slowly drove on past her up the hill. A little further up we drove past a huge truck which had slipped into a ditch on the side of the road. A smaller van about a third the size of it was trying to tow it out. I wouldn't be surprised if it's still there now.

Towards the top grey smoke billowed out of a tyre at the entrance to a pitstop. At this height the temperature has dropped to that of a pleasant British summers day but cold enough for locals to be shivering. A little way further down the road we were motioned to pull over by a man with a machine gun. We were asked to step out and our passports where checked whilst our bus was searched. It was a pretty disconcerting experience helped a little that the bus drivers were so relaxed about it that they'd both gone for a wee behind a rock. 

According to another traveller the road used to be even less safe. Before the Laos government set up patrols on the road a minibus like ours had gone down the route carrying locals and two tourists. Then too people with machine guns had pulled the bus over but rather than checking their passports they had instead shot everyone on board, killing 8. As we rolled on down the hill we passed through a small hill that had been cleared for the road. As we drove by a young boy watched from the side wearing shorts, a t-shirt and an AK-47 over his shoulder. 

The road became straighter and better maintained as we came down the hill making it look alot safer. To make up for this the minibus driver began speeding down the hill, one hand on the wheel and one on his phone, honking relentlessly at anyone unfortunate enough to be in his path. 

As the sun set we got a glimpse of another Laos. Wooden shacks shared the street with brick houses. Cows and water buffalo ambled lazily down the river. Kids cycled home from school and no one - apart from our manic driver - seemed in any kind of hurry. 

## Vang Vieng


Vang Vieng is the best place in the world I've ever been hungover. Just around the corner from where we were staying where two restaurants with large roll out matteresses and piles of soft pillows. Huge quantities of hot, cheap and pretty tasty food was available and they're happy for you to sleep there for large portions of the day.

Plus you had the tremendous view of craggy limestone karsts jutting out from the ground to stare at in awe as you recover.

Booming noise whilst we were cycling

- Vang Vieng
    - Best place in the world to be hungover. Big pillows on 
    - Crispy fried, coconut puffs that you could only get in the morning.
    - Night market
    - Pad Kapow (actually Krapow but it's so spicy)
        - Polystyrene 
        - Possibly the best thing I've ever eaten.
