## Huay-Xai
### Welcome to Laos
The shabby tuk tuk's looked out of place amongst the decorative street lights and clean concrete pillars of the border control, Friendship Bridge 4. A smooth tarmac road winded through the wild hills, heading deeper into Laos. The price for a tuk tuk was extortionate but we didn't have time to wait for the bus and we could not afford to miss the ferry.

As soon as the border was out of sight the road began to fall apart quickly deterioating to a borderline dirt track littered with potholes. We soon came to the first of several bridges. Wooden slats were screwed haphazardly to an iron frame with two rows of planks nailed across in the other direction to bridge the gaps between the slats. The planks were placed just wide enough so that a single tuk tuk or two mopeds could cross it at a time - an ingenious design really since it looked like it might collapse under any more weight.

We turned off towards a town and the road gave up completely. Heading out were several vehicles I can best describe as drag-tractors with big bulky engines strapped to a wooden platform tugging along large trailers. We passed a hospital and I made a mental note not to get sick whilst we were in Laos. I was glad I remembered to take my anti-malaria pills the night before especially considering what we had planned. Our tuk-tuk dropped us off at the end of a more touristy road lined with colorful stalls selling snacks, fresh food and beer. Essentials for the long boat journey ahead.

### The (Very) Slow Boat to Luang Prabang
Your given a seat number when you buy a ticket but the actual seating is a scramble. Any locals get the best seats at the front of the boat. The remaining seats are allocated to distribute people fairly evenly over the boats that are meant to be leaving that day. Me and Sam managed to nab a good seat at the back of the boat in the habital zone near the toilet, but not too near. Others weren't so lucky and ended up stuck sitting in the aisles. Not ideal when your meant to be there for the next 8 hours.

The crew of the different boats shouted to each other as they used long poles to push themselves clear from the docks and from each other. The shouting communicated nothing to me - and maybe the crew were the same since it took a good 15 minutes of pushing and pulling with boats knocking and rolling into each other to get everyone out and onto the wide Mekong river.

Once there it is rather peaceful. The engine rumbles gently, the water stroking the side of the boat and the gentle ebb and flow of friendly conversation amongst strangers. Outside no space is wasted, life clinging on to every surface it can find. At times the shores is so dense with plants it would be impenetrable to all but the most determined whilst in the clearer spaces where the land is flatter you'll see signs of people who live off the river - cattle drinking by the river, kids playing in the sand, perhaps a small village.

After 4 hours of stunning scenery, and with no end in sight, I was thoroughly bored of looking out the window of a boat. Luckily the state owned brewery produces a surprisingly good beer (that's one point for communism) and after a few Beerlao's the hours just sailed by.

## Luang Prabang
### Arrival
Two days later, including a nights rest at a purpose built village halfway, we were finally approaching our destination. The boat stops at a makeshift dock just outside of town where tuk tuks wait to transport people the last mile.

The river itself winds all the way through Luang Prabang and we soon found ourselves walking along it as the sun started to set. It's a confusing place at times, full of winding roads and ever changing architecture. National and communist flags sway gently from the eaves of stern French colonial buildings. The regular measured designs of the European buildings in stark contrast to the flowing shapes of the many temples.

We eventually found a guesthouse halfway down a wide and winding alley. More traditionally it could have been a road but both sides of it were lined with stalls leaving only enough space for foot traffic. At this time of night the alley is full of food to meet any appetite whether you want something BBQ'd black or prefer your dinner still wriggling. Nestled under a small arch was a small mountain of food: bowls of rice the size of a car wheel, heaps of fresh BBQ'd meat, spicy sauces - and maybe some vegetables in there somewhere too. I didn't recognise half of what ended up on my plate but it all tasted excellent.

Looking to contribute to the local economy we set to exploring the nearby bars. First Utopia: a zen garden style bar, completely open to the elements and almost pitch black. Not a great place to drink too much in case you end up stumbling into the river. And after that: well that was almsot it actually. Turns out Laos is much stricter on it's curfew than Thailand so the bars have to shut pretty early. We ended up finishing the night in a bowling alley a little way out of town which just so happened to still be selling beer. It was surprisingly legitimate looking but that didn't stop some people and more than a few ended up in the gutter.

### Atovaquone/Proguanil
That night I dreamt of boats.

When I woke everyone else was still asleep. It was just me and the Laotion man standing next to my bed staring at me. His face, a foot from mine, bearing a massive grin.

Largely unconcious, I ignored him and went back to sleep.

The next morning I sat straight upright as I tried to understand what had happened. As it turns out one possible side effect of the antimalarials we were taking are vivid dreams even bordering on hallucinations. I had vivid dreams of boats every day I was in Laos but the strange man never reappeared.

### Same same but... 
The mad little alley near our hostel looked very different in the early morning. Most of the morning market had left or were leaving, carrying away exotic foods I hadn't even seen in the buffet and huge quantities of chilli.

Once you get your bearings the town for the most part consists of many fairly indistinguishable restaurants. That didn't really click until we sat down for lunch. The stalls were arranged in a horsehoe pattern with some tables shared in the centre. The owner of the nearest stall held held out a colourful menu to us listing a mix of French crepes, baguettes and smoothies. The next stall also had a menu listing... an identical mix of French crepes, baguettes and smoothies only on different colour paper. Past the menu each stall was identical organised. Two man teams, well usually a man and a woman, with one taking orders and the other making sandwiches behind. Alternatingly decorated with fizzy drink cans or bowels of fruit.

The same thing appears throughout the whole town. All the bars have the same Beerlao branded signs, crates, placemats, table clothes... At night the hundreds of brightly lit stalls stretching down the high street somehow all sell the same five things. If you ever find yourself with a pressing need for hundreds of beerlao t-shirts or overpriced rugs or otherwise fancy a cutlerly set made entirely of exploded ordnance then you need to visit the Luang Prabang night market. Otherwise, give it a miss.

I'm not sure what could have caused this phenomenon. There's certainly some pressure from the communist government, it's too organised for anything else but there still needs to have been some cultural pressure to start things off and to have kept it goings. To take a wild guess I'd say it's a result of a culture not used to competition. If everyone works together then no one needs to work as hard, especially when things are already tough. The downside being that new approaches are penalised. If it goes well you may face resentment for your success. If it goes poorly the community must support you. Anyone who tries to stand out, stands alone.

The internet did point us to some cool places further afield like a restaurant in the back of an expats garden we had the best pizza I think I've ever had, which like the burger from Bangkok, says something about the quality of cooking in the west or perhaps in the east. And there are some objectively beautiful parts of town but architecture doesn't really do anything for me. Some 'early' mornings (09:00) whilst smart people slept off their hangovers I roamed about town myself but I never could find much of interest. Only more of the same, better hidden. As it turns out there is a reason why some paths are well trodden.

The only advantage of the facade being so thin is that you can see that there is more going on if you care to look. Very late at night when most the tourists have long been sleeping, people work to prepare the city for the next day. Women on the night market pack up their wares into wheelbarrows and head off to somewhere far away in the night. A truck quietly rolls down our alley whilst workers pick rubbish off the street with their bare hands. There are stories to find here if you have the time but in a scant few days we were moving on.

### Route 13
There are two ways to get from Luang Prabang to Vang Vieng. A minibus that goes directly to Vang Vieng winding over the mountain in between and a conventional bus that is too large to climb the mountain and instead works its way around the long way. We'd been warned before that the minibus route although quicker, was far more dangerous. The road over the mountain winds sharply and steeply. Much of the road is unfinished and most of what has been completed had cracked and slipped leading to 1/2 metre drops along the road to navigate. Unfortunately I stopped listening at 'quicker'.

Littering the road were others failed efforts at the climb. We turned one corner and saw an overturned car that had somehow rolled down the steep road and luckily came to a rest at a safe corner. A woman nearby stared bewildered at us as we slowly drove on past her up the hill. A little further up we drove past a huge truck which had slipped into a ditch on the side of the road. A smaller van about a third the size of it was trying to tow it out. I wouldn't be surprised if it's still there now.

At the top of the mountain the temperature has dropped to that of a pleasant British summers day, cold enough for locals to be shivering, where we pulled into a rest stop. The man I was sitting next to was nervously describing another grim danger of the road. Despite being one of the main roads through Laos most of the road is very quiet. This makes it an ideal ambush point for Royalist insurgents who had been fighting the government for so long their children had taken up the cause. It had been at it's worst in the 2000s but things were apparently picking up again with a number of incidents as recently as March.

We left the rest stop and rounded the corner to see three men with machine guns. We were waved down, asked to step out and our passports where checked whilst a man with a machine gun searched the bus. Meanwhile the bus drivers were so relaxed about it that they'd both gone for a wee behind a rock. Eventually they thanked us and waved us on.

As we rolled on down the hill we passed through a small hill that had been cleared for the road. A young boy stared from the top as we passed in shorts and a t-shirt with the distinct outline of an AK-47 slung over his shoulder.

The road became straighter and better maintained as we came down the hill making it look alot safer. To make up for this the minibus driver began speeding down the hill, one hand on the wheel and one on his phone, honking relentlessly at anyone unfortunate enough to be in his path. 

As the sun set we got a glimpse of another Laos. Wooden shacks shared the street with brick houses. Cows and water buffalo ambled lazily down the river. Kids cycled home from school and no one - apart from our manic driver - seemed in any kind of hurry. 

As seems to be the Laotion tradition we were dropped us just far enough outside of town that we'd have to get one of the nearby tuk tuks. As is the British tradition upon arriving in a new place, we set to trying to drink the town dry. Unfortunately Vang Vieng is a recovering party town and put up more of a fight than Chiang Mai. I have a hazy memory of what happened the rest of that evening but judging by my headache the next day, I think it won.

## Vang Vieng
### 
Vang Vieng is the best place in the world I've ever been hungover. Just around the corner from where we were staying where two restaurants with large roll out matteresses and piles of soft pillows. Huge quantities of hot, cheap and pretty tasty food was available and they're happy for you to sleep there for large portions of the day.

And if I felt the need to do some sightseeing I only need lift my head off the pile of pillows and see this:

to be content for another few hours. As it turns out as well as it being the party town in Laos it is also surrounded by some of the most stunning scenery in South East Asia. A good thing too as Vang Vieng is suffering through a hangover of it's at the moment...

The Nam Song river that runs near the town used to be packed with bars, rope swings and slides which mixed with hidden rocks and cheap drugs led to paralysis, drownings and other grim ways to end a holiday. After news of the deaths and injuries couldn't be contained anymore the government stepped in and forcibly closed down the bars tearing everything down. There is now only two bars in the river.

Still the futures bright for Vang Vieng, once it sorts itself out. Huge stone karsts that erupt from around the town are truly stunning and will be a draw for visitors now the party has ended - plus due to the huge amounts of unexploded ordnance that the Americans left behind after the Vietnam war there will always be a need for local guides.

### The Morning Market
Early-ish one morning in what may have been a slightly drunken haze from the night before I was heading too my favourite restaurant to sleep and eat fried rice till I felt human again when I turned onto a long road either side which sat several people with their wares in front of them. Plastic sheets with fresh meat, more chillis, wait is that a snake? For some reason I was drawing more than a few looks at the time so I walked on through. Remembering my promise to explore further I made a mental note to reappear when I was more presentable before passing out on some cushions.

The next day after a more sensible evening and a much earlier morning I headed back to where I'd last seen the market. It was early enough that the monks were out on the town. You could just about hear them chanting prayers in return for offerings of rice. It wasn't quite bustling, the number of people selling far outweighed the number of people actually buying anything and it barely took up more than two streets but it was one of the most fascinating things I'd seen in Laos. For starters it was indeed a snake. The man who'd caught it had placed it in a large bamboo hat, flat in the middle with steep edges. The snake was mostly still basking in the hot sun but every few minutes it would try to escape and he would tilt the hat up and swirl it around to bring the snake back to the centre. 

Next to the snake man another person was sitting behind a confused ball of frogs which he had collected. Each frog had one foot tied to another frogs foot so that they couldn't progress unless they all moved at once. Being frogs, it didn't look like they were going to make it far.

A little to the side from the main market a large stall was preparing something that smelt delicious, even over the raw meat and amphibians. It sold all sorts of breakfast options that I'd never come across before but the one that caught my nose and my eye were these small deep fried buns sprinkled with cocunut. I bought one and tried it. I then bought six more. Three for me and three to share.

I got pretty addicted to those glorious little coconut buns. As it turns out pretty much every restaurant in Laos sells them if you can get there early enough, but you have to get there early as they've usually sold out by 7:00. This lead to one of the only times in my life I've got up at 6AM by my own free will, to get to that market and get my daily fix.

### Cycling
We decided to rent a bike and try one of the cycle routes around the town. It's a challenging cycle which starts as soon as you try and leave. A huge haphazard bridge crosses the river, a megasized version of the one we'd seen when first visiting Laos. Whoever built it must have had a sense of humour as the 2x4s that allow you to cross the bridge have been placed in a zig zag pattern. 

This part of the story is probably best told through pictures.

Phang Som cave near the blue lagoon. A popular tourist spot but it was mostly locals when we were there. It's pitch black inside and the cave is massive. I wouldn't say we got lost exactly - but we did end up spending a bit more time finding the exit than we'd planned for.

The cycle isn't particularly long but the quality of the road varies massively. Roads like this one that connected villages are well trodden down by people and animals and relatively nice to cycle on. At other times though there were long stretches of gravel or mud that are exhausting to cycle through. Still, it was well worth the effort.

The sun was threatening to set on us on the return leg of the cycle. I couldn't get a good photo from the road but didn't want to stray far off of it. Shortly after taking this photo I went over a bump that made a distinct metallic noise. We cycled pretty quickly after that.

### Leaving
The day we left I was up again at 6AM to enjoy what had become my routine for the last time. I headed to the morning market as usual. The frogs were still looking well but the snake was especially still today having had it's head removed. Perhaps he got tired of swilling it around. I picked up some of the coconut puffs once more. Everything was going well till I made a terrible mistake. Usually at this point I'd head back to the hostel to sleep or into town to walk and, well, sleep but today we had a bus to catch so there was no sense heading to a restaurant. In front of me I saw a sign that I thought read 'Pad Kapow - 5000'. It sounded a bit made up but it was cheap, I was curious and the stall hadn't let me down so far so I went for it.

Back at the hostel I pried open the styrofoam box containing my mysterious meal. Inside lay a mound of sticky rice and a glorious pile of meat and chilli. Lots of chilli. We'd eaten a lot of hot food on our travels so far but this one really blew my head off. Worse beneath all that chilli was probably the best meal I'd eaten, definitely in Laos. Possibly ever.

It was over all too soon and I was left with an empty plastic bag and a oil soaked styrofoam box. Sad reminders of the meal that had just been. I considered getting another. But no, it would not be the same. The many missed opportunities struck me - all those days I could have eaten it only to discover it when I may never try it again. I took comfort knowing that it I would always carry it with me - or would at least for the next 8 hours or so.

I came to terms with my mistake just as a rusty old minivan turned up missing one door. We stepped on to leave Laos, and I was glad to have seen it.
