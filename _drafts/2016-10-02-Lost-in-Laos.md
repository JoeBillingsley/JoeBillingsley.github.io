## Huay-Xai

### Welcome to Laos
The shabby tuk tuk's looked out of place amongst the decorative steel lights and clean concrete pillars of the border crossing - Friendship Bridge 4. A smooth tarmac road winded through the wild hills, heading deeper into Laos. The fare was extortionate but we had a ferry to catch.

As soon as the border was out of sight the road fell apart, deterioating to a borderline dirt track scattered with potholes. We soon came to the first of several homemade bridges. Wooden slats are screwed horizontally to an iron frame. In the other direction two thin rows of planks bridge the gaps between the slats, placed just wide enough so that a single tuk tuk or two mopeds could cross it at a time. An ingenious design since it could collapse under any more weight.

We turned off towards a town and the road gave up completely. Leaving the town were several vehicles I can best describe as drag-tractors. Big bulky engines strapped to a wooden platform tugging along large trailers. We passed a hospital and I made a mental note not to get sick whilst we were in Laos. I was glad I remembered to take my anti-malaria pills the night before. Our tuk-tuk dropped us off at the end of a touristy road lined with colorful stalls selling snacks, fresh food and perhaps most importantly for a long boat journey - beer. Laos was off to a good start.

### The (Very) Slow Boat to Luang Prabang
We were given a seat number when you buy a ticket but as it turns out that doesn't mean much. Any locals get the roomy seats at the front of the boat. Everyone else is distributed roughly evenly over the boats that are leaving that day and you just get the best seat you can. For some people that meant sitting in the aisle - not ideal when your meant to be there for the next 8 hours.

The crew stood on the deck and forced our way out of the dock. Pushing and pulling, boats knocking and rolling together before we were out and onto the wide Mekong river. 

Once there it is rather peaceful. The engine rumbles gently, the water stroking the side of the boat and the gentle ebb and flow of friendly conversation amongst strangers. Outside life clings on to every surface it can find. At times the shore is so dense with plants it becomes just a wall of green whilst in the clearer spaces where the land is flatter you'll see signs of people living off the river - cattle drinking by the river, kids playing in the sand, fishing boats and a small village.

After 4 hours of stunning scenery and with no end in sight I was thoroughly bored of looking out the window of a boat. Luckily the state owned brewery produces a surprisingly good beer (one point for communism) and after a few Beerlao's the hours just sailed by.

## Luang Prabang

### Arrival
Two days later, including a nights rest at a purpose built village halfway, we were finally approaching our destination. The boat stopped at a makeshift dock just outside of town where tuk tuks wait to transport (and charge) people the last mile.

The river itself winds all the way through Luang Prabang and we soon found ourselves walking along it as the sun started to set. It's a confusing place at times, full of winding roads and ever changing architecture. National and communist flags sway gently from the eaves of stern French colonial buildings. The regular measured designs of the European buildings in stark contrast to the flowing shapes of the many temples.

We eventually found a guesthouse halfway down a wide and winding alley. More traditionally it would have been a road but both sides of it were lined with stalls leaving barely enough space for foot traffic. At this time of night the alley is full of food to suit any appetite whether you want something BBQ'd black or prefer your dinner still wriggling. Nestled under a small arch was a small mountain of food: bowls of rice the size of a car wheel, heaps of fresh BBQ'd meat, spicy sauces - and a splash of vegetables for decoration. I didn't recognise half of what ended up on my plate but it all tasted excellent.

Looking to contribute to the local economy we set to exploring the nearby bars. First Utopia. A zen garden style bar, completely open to the elements and almost pitch black. Not a great place to drink too much in case you end up stumbling into the river. And after that: well that was almsot it actually. Turns out Laos is much stricter on it's curfew than Thailand so the bars have to shut pretty early. We ended up finishing the night in a 'bowling alley' a little way out of town which just so happened to still be selling beer. It turned out to be a legitimate bowling alley and outrageously expensive but that didn't stop some people from drinking themselves into the gutter.

### Atovaquone/Proguanil
That night I took my antimalarials and I dreamt of boats.

When I woke everyone else was still asleep. It was just me and the Laotian man standing next to my bed staring at me. His face, a foot from mine, bearing a massive grin.

Largely unconcious I ignored him and went back to sleep.

The next morning I sat straight upright as I tried to understand what had happened. As it turns out one possible side effect of the antimalarials we were taking are vivid dreams  bordering on hallucinations. I had vivid dreams of boats every day I was in Laos but the strange man never reappeared.

### Same Same But... 
The mad little alley near our hostel looked very different in the early morning. Most of the morning market had left or was leaving, carrying away exotic foods I hadn't even seen in the buffet and huge quantities of chilli.

I got a strange feeling of deja vu walking around Luang Prabang but it didn't really click why until we sat down for lunch. The stalls were arranged in a horsehoe pattern with some tables shared in the centre. As we approached the nearest stall the owner held held out a colourful menu to us listing a mix of French crepes, baguettes and smoothies. The next stall also held out a menu listing... an identical mix of French crepes, baguettes and smoothies only on different colour paper. Past the menu each stall was identical organised, a man and a woman, with one taking orders and the other making food behind, each stall alternatingly decorated with fizzy drink cans or bowls of fruit.

This pattern turns up throughout the whole town. All the bars have the same Beerlao branded signs, crates, placemats, table clothes... At night hundreds of brightly lit stalls stretching down the high street will almost exclusively sell the same five things. If you ever find yourself with a pressing need for hundreds of beerlao t-shirts or overpriced rugs or otherwise fancy a cutlerly set made entirely of exploded ordnance then you need to visit the Luang Prabang night market. Otherwise, give it a miss.

The only advantage of the facade being so thin is that you can get glimpses of the inner workings underneath. When the tourists head to bed the women on the night market pack up their wares into wheelbarrows and head off to somewhere far away in the night. Whilst we sleep, men work to prepare the city for the next day. A truck quietly rolls down our alley whilst workers pick rubbish off the street with their bare hands. There are stories to find here if you have the time but in a scant few days we were moving on.

### Route 13
There are two ways to get from Luang Prabang to Vang Vieng. A minibus that goes directly to Vang Vieng winding over the mountain in between and a conventional bus that is too large to climb the mountain and instead works its way around it. We'd been warned before that the minibus route although quicker, was far more dangerous. The road over the mountain winds sharply and steeply. Much of it is unfinished and most of what has been completed has cracked and slipped leading to 1/2 metre drops to navigate. On top of that there were whispers of ambushes attacking buses some time ago. Unfortunately we stopped listening at 'quicker'.

Littering the road were others failed efforts at the climb. We turned one corner and saw an overturned car that must have rolled off the road and came to a rest at a safe corner. The driver didn't even flinch and a woman near the car stared bewildered at us as we slowly drove on past her. A little further up a huge truck had slipped into a ditch on the side of the road. A smaller van about a third it's size was trying to tow it out. I wouldn't be surprised if it's still there now.

At the top of the mountain the temperature has dropped to that of a pleasant British summers day, cold enough for locals to be shivering, where we pulled into a rest stop. The man I was sitting next to was describing a grim story of the road. Despite being one of the main roads through Laos most of the road is very quiet. This makes it an ideal ambush point for the remnants of Royalist insurgents who have been fighting the government for so long their children have since taken up the cause. It had been at it's worst in the 2000s but with an incident as recently as March.

We left the rest stop and rounded the corner to see three men with machine guns. 

They waved us down, asked us to step out and checked our passports whilst one of them searched the bus. I'd have been more nervous but the bus drivers were so relaxed that they'd gone for a wee behind a rock. Eventually they thanked us and waved us on. As we rolled on down the hill we passed through a small hill that had been cleared for the road. A young boy stared from the top as we passed wearing shorts and a t-shirt with the distinct outline of an AK-47 slung over his shoulder.

The road became straighter and less terrifying as we came down the hill. To compensate the driver began speeding down the hill with one hand on the wheel and one on his phone. As the sun set we got a glimpse of rural Laos speeding by. Water buffalo ambling lazily down the river, kids cycled home from school and no one - apart from our manic driver - looked in any kind of hurry. 

As seems to be Laotion tradition we were dropped just far enough outside of town that we'd have to get a nearby tuk tuk. As is the British tradition upon arriving in a new place, we set to trying to drink the town dry. Unfortunately Vang Vieng is a recovering party town and put up more of a fight than Chiang Mai. I have a hazy memory of what happened the rest of that evening but judging by my headache the next day, I think Vang Vieng won.

## Vang Vieng

### The Best Medicine
Vang Vieng is the best place in the world I've ever been hungover. If it was in my power I would wake up there every Saturday morning following a Friday night, in the restaurant around the corner from our hostel collapsed on piles of soft pillows in the shade on a warm morning.

And if I felt the need to do some sightseeing I would only need lift my head off the pile of pillows and see this...

![The view from my pillow pit]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2016-10-02-Lost-in-Laos/IMG_20161007_154234807_HDR.jpg "The view from my pillow pit")

...to be content for another few hours. As it turns out as well as it being the party town in Laos it is also surrounded by some of the most stunning scenery in South East Asia. A good thing too as Vang Vieng is suffering through a hangover of it's own at the moment.

The Nam Song river that runs near the town used to be packed with bars, rope swings and slides which mixed with hidden rocks and cheap drugs led to paralysis, drownings and other grim ways to end a holiday. After news of the deaths and injuries couldn't be contained anymore the government stepped in and forcibly closed down the bars tearing everything down. There is now only two bars in the river.

Still the futures bright for Vang Vieng. The huge stone karsts that erupt from around the town are stunning and will be a draw for visitors now the party has ended - plus due to the huge amounts of unexploded ordnance that the Americans left behind after the Vietnam war there will always be a need for local guides.

### The Morning Market
Earlier than usual one morning in a slightly drunken haze I was heading too my favourite restaurant to sleep and eat fried rice till I felt human again when I turned onto a long road either side which sat several people with their wares in front of them. Plastic sheets with fresh meat, more chillis... a snake? Perhaps due to being the only tourist I was drawing more than a few looks at the time so I walked on through. Remembering my promise to get off the beaten path a little I made a mental note to reappear when I was more presentable and then passed out on some cushions.

The next day after a more sensible evening and a much earlier morning I headed back to where I'd last seen the market. It was early enough that I could hear the monks out on the town, chanting prayers in return for offerings of rice. The market wasn't quite bustling, the number of people selling far outweighed the number of people actually buying anything and it barely took up more than two streets but it was one of the most fascinating things I saw on the trip. One man was holding a bamboo hat with a snake in it basking in the sun. Every few minutes the snake would try to slither to freedom and the man would simply tilt the hat up and swirl it around to bring the snake back to the centre. 

Another man was sitting behind a confused ball of frogs. Each frog had one foot tied to another frogs foot so that they could only progress if they all moved at once. Being frogs it didn't look like they were going to make it far.

But the best part was a little to the side of the main market. A large stall was preparing something that smelt delicious even over the raw meat and amphibians. It sold all sorts of pastries that I'd never seen before but the one that caught my nose and my eye were these small deep fried buns sprinkled with cocunut. I bought one to try it. I then bought six more. Three for me and three to share.

I got pretty addicted to those glorious little coconut buns. As it turns out pretty much every restaurant in Laos sells them if you can get there early enough, but you have to get there early as they've usually sold out by 7:00. This lead to one of the few periods in my life where I've been getting up at 6AM by my own free will... a man will do anything for those coconut buns.

### Cycling
We decided to rent a bike and try one of the cycle routes going out of town. A huge haphazard bridge crosses the river going out of town, a megasized version of the one we'd seen when first visiting Laos. Whoever built it must have had a sense of humour too as the 2x4s that allow you to cross the bridge have been placed in a zig zag pattern. 

I think this part of the story is probably best told through pictures:

![Phang som cave]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2016-10-02-Lost-in-Laos/IMG_20161008_131245163.jpg "Phang som cave")

Phang Som cave near the blue lagoon. A popular tourist spot apparently but it was mostly locals when we were there. It's pitch black inside and the cave is massive. I wouldn't say we got lost exactly but we did end up spending a bit more time finding the exit than we'd planned for.

The cycle isn't particularly long but the quality of the road varies massively. Most of it is dirt tracks, well trodden down by people and animals and relatively nice to cycle on. At other times though there were long stretches of gravel or thick mud that are exhausting to cycle through. Still it was well worth the effort.

![Limestone karsts over a field]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2016-10-02-Lost-in-Laos/IMG_20161008_161718024_HDR.jpg "Limestone karsts over a field")

The sun was threatening to set on us on the return leg of the cycle. Shortly after taking this photo I went over a bump that made a distinct metallic noise. We cycled pretty quickly after that.

### Leaving
The day we left I was up once more. I headed to the morning market as usual. The frogs were still looking well but the snake was especially still today having had it's head removed. I picked up some of the coconut puffs. Everything was going well. Usually at this point I'd head back to the hostel to sleep or into town to walk and, well, sleep but today we had a bus to catch so there was no sense heading to a restaurant. In front of me I saw a sign that I thought read 'Pad Kapow - 5000'. It sounded a bit made up but it was cheap, I was curious and the stall hadn't let me down so far so I went for it.

Back at the hostel I pried open the styrofoam box containing my mysterious meal. Inside lay a mound of sticky rice and a glorious pile of meat and chilli. Lots of chilli. We'd eaten a lot of hot food on our travels so far but this one was dangerously hot. Worse beneath all that chilli was quite possibly the best meal I've eaten. Definitely for the trip. Possibly ever.

It was over all too soon and I was left with an empty plastic bag and a oil soaked styrofoam box. Sad reminders of the meal that had just been. I considered getting another. But no, it would not be the same. The many missed opportunities struck me - all those days I could have eaten it only to discover it when I may never try it again. I took comfort knowing that it I would carry it with me always or at the very least for the next 8 hours or so.

I came to terms with my last meal just as a rusty old minivan turned up missing one door. We stepped on to leave Laos and I was glad to have seen it.
