Lesson: You're always training your horse

- At a riding school they teach you the 'fundamental techniques' of riding
    - If you kick it, it moves
    - If it doesn't move kick it harder
- 'firmness'
- 'energy' and getting a horse excited so they are moving better

- There is only so good you can get doing something for an hour a week so when I've had the opportunity and the time I've often gone and worked in interesting places where there is an opportunity for me to get better.
- Austria, Sweden, Ireland etc.

- Most recently back in 2017 before I started my PhD this took me to Ireland

- Introduce location, job and horse
- Tell story of riding out towards a field when everyone else was away
- Taking a wrong turn and horse being very reluctant to go
- Turning and horse bolting, spinning and falling off
- Putting on helmet, getting on again, nudging horse and being thrown off
- Third attempt, making horse run, gaining his attention and not having problems again

- These experiences determined the way I rode for the next few years, though perhaps I took the wrong lessons from them

- When I started a PhD I did what I always do when I'm in a new place and tried to find a horse to ride
- Found a stable and a horse called Isca
- This was the first time I'd ridden the same horse for this long and it was instructive

- If it was especially windy or cold or hot or wet or perhaps she just seemed a little under the weather and she seemed reluctant to go on a longer route I'd turn us off towards the shorter path and we'd cut it a bit shorter that day.
- But over time Isca seemed more and more reluctant to go on a longer route even when the weather was good and she required more and more pressure to get her to go at all
- I tried to improve my technique to fix these things. Improve my foot placement, more contact etc but none of the techniques I'd been taught at the riding schools really worked. When I stumbled upon something that did work it was usually something counterintuitive. Isca got easier to manage when I used less contact

- She tended to try and run home and I was advised to turn her head to one side so she couldn't see where she was going as easily. This worked for a time until she got very good at running sideways. 

The heart of the problem was I was focussing on technique too much when I should have been thinking of training. I'd always considered training to be very advanced, something that only very experienced riders should attempt. But the truth is you are always training your horse to do *something*. Every time you ride and every moment before and after. Most horses are taught with reinforcement learning. The right action should result in some positive aspect and the wrong one with a negative aspect. With horses a positive action is usually a release of pressure whilst a negative one is usually something painful or annoying like increasing presssure or a thwack with a whip.

At the riding schools I'd been too they'd say you need to be 'firm' but this is vague and a little incomplete. A much more useful way of thinking about it is as being 'clear' and 'consistent'. Each action should have a clear meaning to the horse or at least a clear intent and the resulting consequences should be equally clear and the same everytime. 

For example if you are training a horse to stop when you pull back the reins you should apply the pressure to the mouth and as soon as they stop release it immediately. This is consistent, the consequence are the same everytime. If they do anything but stop there is pressure in their mouth and the moment they find the correct action it goes away. When you are out and about it is easy for this action to be unclear.

- If you ride without considering the training of the horse you end up doing what I did and subtly teaching the horse they can have an easier time of things if they put up a bit more resistance.
- Sometimes my actions were unclear:
    - It is difficult to maintain a consistent and light pressure on the reins and if you don't manage this then the horse is dealing with a lot of different pressures throughout the ride. When you ask them to stop this direction can be lost amongst all of the noise. As a result I found it easier to ride Isca on a long rein most of the time as then the indication to slow or stop was significantly different to the normal noise.  
- Sometimes my actions were inconsistent:
    - Like when I sometimes allowed them to turn home and other times I did not
- A horse can learn a behaviour from a single instance

A reinforcement learning perspective isn't enough. It doesn't explain why 'horse' became so much more amenable after I chased him around an arena. At least not satisfactorily. I believe this comes down to the way in which horses see other horses and people as entities to respect and trust - or otherwise. This is not a subject I understand well enough to write about but this is a reminder that it would be a mistake to treat a horse as a simple machine, they are individuals in and of themselves.
