## Vietnam
Bear Grylls analogy. What Bear Grylls would throw together if he was lost in a city.

Crossing the road in Vietnam is like walking through a flock of birds. 

The sky cracked open and rain poured out. When the lightning struck it sounded like concrete snapping, like a building being broken clean in half.

A gecko crawled up the wall. 

We'd missed the flights and now I had the shits. Only then did I realise how much I was looking forward to getting back. I'd really enjoyed the trip and there was a lot I was leaving behind but I missed a lot of home too. I missed safe roads, cheddar, good Indian curry, wearing jumpers, crappy TV and poo's that didn't come out like herbal tea. I missed cold air and the way your breath frosts on cold nights. I missed home and my family.

## Hanoi

### Lego-land

Our first hour in Vietnam was spent scouring the airport to find the cheapest place to buy a sim card. Outside the taxi drivers were charging extortionate fees (by our standards) to get into the city. By this point we were too cheap and too suspicious to fall for that so our next few hours were spent trying to track down the bus into town which we somehow just kept missing.

It was well into the night when we finally made it into Hanoi and we once again found ourselves ~~lost~~ temporarily uncertain of our position. The wide streets of the old quarter were dead quiet. The tall buildings that surrounded us looked almost alien in the moonlight, their weak porchlights cast angular shadows onto the road. In the distance horns were beeping. When we finally made it to our hostel I passed out almost immediately.

We woke to another city. Stalls had sprouted up like mushrooms over night and the streets were flooded with people. The dissonant melody of beeping traffic plays constantly as mopeds edge their way through the crowd. In the daylight the ecletic architecture was clear. Sloping rooftops are stacked on each other and at every angle, balconies jut out irregularly metal staircases climb the walls and there is every conceivable kind of window, railing and door. It looked lke it had been put together out of a hundred different LEGO sets, the only thing binding it together being how much it all stood apart.

It was incredibly easy to get lost at first in part because it's always changing. Roads close and markets open, throngs of people can appear in an instant and suddenly your a world apart from where you once stood. For a little while each night, some roads become restaurants and everywhere will be full of families and friends on plastic seats and tables. And then just as fast it appeared the city is silent for a while, the only noise the buzz of welders as they expand the city to new heights.

The first few days in Hanoi were spent getting used to the rhythm of the city, the way it tensed and breathed with the movement of the sun. And that was actually something I really liked about the place. It has it's own identity and more so, Hanoi, and most of Vietnam, didn't bend over backwards to make things easy for you. It didn't seem like it was built for tourists rather it had enough confidence in itself to trust that people would work a bit for it. So it was a challenge at times but it felt good to work at it because you had to learn some things to get to know it and to get the most out of it.

The first thing we learnt from exploring the city and with the help of one or two pub crawls organised by the hostel, was the layout of the city. The mad part I've been describing is characteristic of the old quarter. Here the sprawl is contained into 36 little streets around since imperial times, where they each originally sold a single good. Many of the streets do still sell one kind of item and whether thats prayer flags, coffee beans, art or less romantically knock off north face gear, these streets are very helpful for getting your bearings.

Outside of the old quarter the city unfolds and opens up. The downside of all this is that buildings that would have been streets apart in the crumpled old quarter are now miles apart once in the rest of the city. 

and getting around becomes much easier. Large corporations must have been kept out of the old quarter since it's surrounded by a ring of American fast food chains which I have mixed feelings about. 

The hostel we stayed at was your standard backpacking fare spread over 10 floors. At the top was the bar - with Nos balloons so big they could burst a lung and panoramic views over, well not the prettiest part of Hanoi. From here
