## Hanoi

### Lego-land

Our first hour in Vietnam was spent scouring the airport to find the cheapest place to buy a sim card. Outside the taxi drivers were charging extortionate fees (by our standards) to get into the city. By this point we were too cheap and too suspicious to fall for that so our next few hours were spent trying to track down the bus into town which we somehow just kept missing.

It was well into the night when we finally made it into Hanoi and we once again found ourselves ~~lost~~ temporarily uncertain of our position. The wide streets of the old quarter were dead quiet. The tall buildings that surrounded us looked almost alien in the moonlight, their weak porchlights cast angular shadows onto the road. In the distance horns were beeping. When we finally made it to our hostel I passed out almost immediately.

We woke to another city. Stalls had sprouted up like mushrooms over night and the streets were flooded with people. The dissonant melody of beeping traffic plays constantly as mopeds edge their way through the crowd. In the daylight the ecletic architecture was clear. Sloping rooftops are stacked on each other and at every angle, balconies jut out irregularly metal staircases climb the walls and there is every conceivable kind of window, railing and door. LEGO
