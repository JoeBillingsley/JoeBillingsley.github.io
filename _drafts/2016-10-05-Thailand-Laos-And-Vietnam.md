### Thailand

TODO: Open and close with Frank. Reflect on Frank at the end.
The big things stay the same. But all of the little things are different.

We met 'Frank' smoking a cigarette under a bridge near a busy road. He was a short man with black hair and was dressed in a worn blue uniform. I was inclined to trust him. His uniform suggested he worked for the train company, he spoke English well and was carrying a map so I figured he must often deal with tourists. He was friendly, intensely friendly and asked a lot of questions. Where are you from? Is this your first day in Bangkok? Where are you staying? Within minutes of meeting him he'd mapped out our stay in Bangkok and onwards down to the full moon party in Koh Phangan. We were to rent a tuk-tuk to take us around the major attractions in the city and then speak to a travel information centre where the locals go who would help us organise a train in time for the party. He even waved down a passing tuk-tuk for us which kindly waited nearby. 

We started to walk away then hit the road. Vehicles streamed relentlessly in front of us. Cars trudged onwards whilst mopeds nimbly changed lanes and cut through the traffic. It was a river of metal and if we wanted lunch we somehow had to cross it. After staring around for a bit looking for some way to dam the stream we asked our old friend Frank for help. Frank strode out in front and parted the waves by stepping out in front of a van and holding his hand out toward it. 

Inside looked grim but smelt great. Fluorescent lights lit a wide room laid with a dirty concrete floor. A few stalls stood facing white plastic tables and chairs. Noodles sizzled and cracked across the room. Hot oil spat furiously at meat and noodles. Spatulas scratched on woks to get every ounce of flavour out of the pan and onto the plate. I stared some more - this time at the unfamiliar letters above the nearest stall. Frank saved us again, walking us to the nearest table and ordering a pad thai each and something resembling coke. Talking to Frank was less pleasent than adverts had described. He talked at us about his hobbies - drinking, smoking, gambling and late nights out clubbing. He seemed intimately familar with how much Thai prostitutes cost and how much more they could charge if they worked in Europe. 

About halfway through the meal 

Conveniently another tuk-tuk had arrived. A bit odd but it was a green tuk-tuk and weren't those supposed to be government sponsored? His demeanour cracked alarmingly. 

After a few of these attempts you stop trusting people.

### Laos

Wide houses with long sloping roofs . Wooden shutters over the windows . National and communist flags sway gently from the eaves.

## Route 13 - A dangerous road
The next day we took a minibus from Luang Prabang to Vang Vieng. There are two options for public transport down this route. A minibus that goes directly to Vang Vieng winding over the mountain in between and a conventional bus that is too large to climb the mountain and works its way around. We'd been warned before that the minibus route although quicker, was far more dangerous. The road over the mountain winds sharply and very steeply. Some of the road was unfinished and most of what had been completed had cracked and slipped leading to 1/2 metre drops along the road to navigate. Littering the road were others failed efforts at traversing the road. We turned one corner and saw an overturned car that had somehow rolled down the steep road and luckily came to a rest at a safe corner. A woman nearby stared bewildered at us as we slowly drove on past her up the hill. A little further up we drove past a huge truck which had slipped into a ditch on the side of the road. I wouldn't be surprised if it's still there now.

Towards the top grey smoke billowed out of a tyre at the entrance to a pitstop. At this height the temperature has dropped to that of a pleasant British summers day but cold enough for locals to be shivering. A little way further down the road we were motioned to pull over by a man with a machine gun. We were asked to step out and our passports where checked whilst our bus was searched. It was a pretty disconcerting experience helped a little that the bus drivers were so relaxed about it that they'd both gone for a wee behind a rock. 

According to another traveller the road used to be even less safe. Before the Laos government set up patrols on the road a minibus like ours had gone down the route carrying locals and two tourists. Then too people with machine guns had pulled the bus over but rather than checking their passports they had instead shot everyone on board, killing 8. As we rolled on down the hill we passed through a small hill that had been cleared for the road. As we drove by a young boy watched from the side wearing shorts, a t-shirt and an AK-47 over his shoulder. 

The road became straighter and better maintained as we came down the hill making it look alot safer. The minibus driver tried to make up for this by speeding down the hill, one hand on the wheel and one on his phone, honking relentlessly at anyone unfortunate enough to be in his path. 

As the sun set I felt I was getting a glimpse of the real Laos. Wooden shacks shared the street with brick houses. Cows and water buffalo ambled lazily down the river. Kids cycled home from school and no one - apart from our manic driver - seemed to be in any kind of hurry. 

Booming noise whilst we were cycling

Vang Vieng is the best place I've ever been hungover. Just around the corner from were I was staying were two restaurants with large roll out matteresses and piles of soft pillows. Huge quantities of hot, cheap and pretty tasty food was available and they didn't mind you sleeping there for large portions of the day. 

Plus you had the tremendous view of craggy limestone karsts jutting out from the ground to stare at in awe as you recover.

Life clings to every surface of the rocks and more life clings on the plants that got there first. 

### Vietnam

Crossing the road in Vietnam is like walking through a flock of birds.
