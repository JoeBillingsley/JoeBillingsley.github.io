## Bangkok

### 'Kev'
The airconditioned carriage of the airport rail link rolled up to the platform. The doors opened and we stepped into a wall of hot, clammy air. I started sweating immediately. The platform looked out onto a mess of buildings, many oozing moss and cracking from disrepair. Tall and unfamiliar trees with masses of soft leaves burst through the concrete below. Me and my friend and travel companion Sam had just arrived in Bangkok.

We met 'Kev' just under the platform smoking a cigarette next to a busy road. He was a short man with black hair and was dressed in a worn blue uniform. He approached us in a friendly manner and asked lots of questions. "Where are you from?", "Where are you staying?", "Is this your first day in Bangkok?". Within minutes of meeting him he'd retrieved a map from his back pocket and planned out our stay in Bangkok and onwards down to the full moon party in Koh Phangan. He even waved down a passing tuk-tuk to take us on a tour around the city.

He seemed dissapointed when we thanked him but asked if he knew somewhere we could get something to eat instead. He laughed and pointed to a large warehouse straight opposite us. Leaving Kev behind, we approached the river of metal three lanes wide that separated us and a meal and waited for an opening so we could cross.

...and waited...

...and waited...

...and gave up and had to ask Kev if he could help us cross the road.

The trick as it turns out is just to walk out straight into the traffic and most of it will find it's way around you and the rest, hopefully, stops. Inside the wide room several tables were laid out in a grid under fluorescent lights. A lizard scuttered over the concrete floor. To one side the noise of the street outside drifted in through the open window whilst the other side seveal stalls fought back with hot oil spitting furiously at meat and noodles as they are thrown into the pan and spatulas scraping sharply against woks. We followed Kev inside and looked at the sign above the nearest stall only to realise that it was only in Thai and I couldn't even begin to guess what they were selling. Kev came to the rescue again and bought us each a tasty mess of soft noodles, ferociously spicy with an unexpectedly coarse texture - the first of many Pad Thai. He talked at us about his interests - drinking, smoking, gambling and late nights out clubbing and about working in Ireland and how cheap Thai prostitutes are compared to European ones. Despite our many efforts he wouldn't let us pay for anything; saying that it hardly cost him anything at all.

After we'd finished eating we headed back outside. Kev reminded us again of the route he had planned out and pointed us to another tuk-tuk that had conveniently pulled over whilst we were talking. When we thanked him for the meal but declined again his demeanour cracked alarmingly. His smiling, intensely friendly face had slipped away revealing something equally intense but alot less friendly. Trying not to notice I just smiled, we thanked him again and walked swiftly away. Moments later we were lost.

### Somewhere in Bangkok
The street was wild and varied. Insulated wires hung like vines between concrete pylons in the street. Lanes of colourful traffic poured down wide roads. Agile motorbikes cut in front of their slower tuk tuk cousins which slowly forced their way though with horns blaring. Brightly coloured taxis stood at a stand still and the skytrain thundered overhead. The city seemed overgrown with vehicles and buildings and people.

We tried referencing the map Kev had given but aside from his annotations for the Thai words for 'hello', 'thank you' and 'big breasts' there was nothing on it of any use. Irritatingly every time we opened the map a taxi driver would immediately drive up the curb and yell and gesture at us to get in. I wasn't keen on getting a taxi anyway but the pushy tactics just pushed me away further. Then we passed a some groups of men and their motorbikes. They wore balaclavas so that you could only see their eyes following you as you walk by. I tried to not stand out - a tricky thing to do with a 70L backpack on your shoulders, halfway across the world from home - and realised quite how exposed we were carrying our lives for the next 6 weeks in our bags and completely lost. So we lured a taxi over, paid the fare and our car set off slowly towards our hostel.

### Tourist attractions
We didn't have much time in Bangkok so we started with the major tourist attractions like the Grand Palace. I don't think either of us were too keen on seeing them in the first place but we went because everyone had and we were worried we might find out later we'd missed out on something. It is generally more polite to cover your sholders and your knees when in Thailand. Sometimes you'll get slightly better service than otherwise but at the Grand Palace a guard enforces you dress correctly. So we ended up queuing 4 times: to rent some trousers, get our bags checked, buy a ticket and finally enter. There are actually two queues at the entrance. One for Thai people and another for everyone else. The local queue is free which seems sort of fair as the tickets were much more than anyone on the average Thai salary could justify.

The entrance is built into an old gate with the ticket stand a little way behind in another more recent looking building. With the big rotating gates and staff standing around it felt more like the entrance to a theme park than a royal palace. But stepping inside I was struck by the variety and detail of the buildings that surrounded me. The site is drenched in colour. Dripping from the golden spires down the tiles that cover the roofs and columns leaving the walls a glistening white. The buildings taper upwards as if they are trying to lift off the ground, their tall spires reaching out trying to poke holes in the clouds. In a sea of colour one of the most striking buildings is almost completely white. It all comes together into a dazzling spectacle. It's very well maintained too. I didn't see a tile out of place anywhere. In fact I found it impossible to say from looking if a building was put there hundreds of years ago or yesterday. And there is no information provided anywhere to relate to what your seeing. There's bins, electronic lights, sun shelters and hundreds of people but no context or stories about the palace. The only signs around are those that direct you to the exit. So whilst stunning at first without something to ground the buildings in they quickly lose their weight and impact.

The other tourist attractions that we saw were much the same - impressive at first but lacking any staying power. They are great to take photos of, or photos in front of, and not alot else.

### Exploring
Luckily Bangkok is enormously varied so though the tourist attractions did nothing for me the various snippets of the city we saw as we roamed between them did. We went looking for a bar one afternoon and stumbled upon a quiet residential area. Rows of small houses stood like reeds next to a river. Only a simple arched bridge crossed over it. Smoke billowed down the street from scrappy bbqs serving flowery white fish on long skewers and rows of sticky meatballs. Nearby, people sat on plastic chairs talking to each other and playing cards. We went over the bridge and down an alley and were in a different city altogether. Here the buildings had grown tall and modern and a straight road ran through them with mopeds zipping along it. Open fronted restaurants were serving every kind of food you might fancy but few were stopping to eat just yet. If you followed that road a while you might meet a dead end but you could be just as likely to find a bustling market or a quiet park or a roaring stadium or anything else for that matter.

You could find anything you want to eat in Bangkok if you knew where to look. We didn't but still stumbled upon some extraordinary food. As expected we ate some excellent Pad Thai and every kind of Thai curry and durian fruit which tastes, not bad necessarily, but so odd I could only manage a few bites. It does to your mouth what seeing a new colour must do to your eyes. Yet one of the best things I ate whilst I was there was some toast. The toast in Bangkok was weirdly good. You get massively thick slices of a slightly sweet bread with just the right amount of crunch to it. Walking around we later found a restaurant which sold exclusively toast with toppings and it was packed. 

### Trust
Roaming about people often try and take advantage of your ignorance. Haggling is essential as everyone assumes you don't know the true value of anything in Thailand and so will open with as much as they think they can get away with. Once we got familiar with the taxis we found out we'd paid roughly 5 times as much for our trip to the hostel than we would have if we'd just gone on the meter. Even once you know how much something should cost you still have to haggle hard to get close to that point as most people expect you to pay more as a tourist. Especially near the tourist attractions people would act frustrated and angry if you weren't willing to pay well over the odds. 

Much worse are the scammers who erode your trust in ordinary people you meet. They often appear friendly and come out of the blue and start a conversation. They usually speak flawless english and after a short chat will kindly let you know that whatever big tourist attraction you've come to see is closed today but that they could sort a tour to everywhere else for you for very cheap. They can be very convincing and if you bite, as I would have if not for Sam, you're get taken on a whistle stop tour of the drivers mates shops and are pressured into buying something at each and every one. There so common that you don't have to be in Bangkok long to get familiar with the red flags so they'll often politely ask early on "Is this your first day in Bangkok?".

Though we met people in Bangkok who were appeared genuinely kind you quickly learn it is safer not to trust anyone.

## Koh Phangan
Bangkok quickly wears you down and so it wasn't long before we were ready to leave. Amongst Kev's ramblings he had told us something useful - if we got a sleeper train we could make it to the Thai islands in time for the legendary Full Moon party. So we went to the train station and bought a combined train, bus and ferry ticket and left Bangkok and settled in for a 12 hour stretch on a train.

### The boat
From my bunk on the train I watched Thailand fly past. Palm trees, towns and villages whizzed by whilst the sun set and rose again. A tinny electric voice called out our stop. The train doors opened revealing a crowd of people offering lifts to the ferry. Tired and confused some people were lured away to unmarked minibuses. Once we'd pushed through the guides and out of the platform we saw a dizzying array of different busses. More guides stood by some of the busses and tried to encourage us in. Sam spotted a bus with a name that matched our ticket, so we dived on and hoped for the best.

It was a relief when a few hours later the pier did in fact come into view and we weren't asked for more money but it was still hours yet before the boat arrived. When we'd finally made it on board we'd been travelling for 15 hours and still had hours to go.

I bought a beer off the toothless man at the bar, slipped off my shoes and settled in for the long haul. Another beer later I'd turned my trousers into shorts and by the fourth I was shirtless. Comfortably tired I stared out at the sea, a stunning turquoise blue dripping with mountainous islands covered in lush green trees. The water invited you in and I couldn't wait to get to the island for a swim but  the sun just blazed on. The 4 hour boat journey slipped by in no time. Only when we landed did I realise that I'd not put on any sun cream at all.

### The Full Moon party
A little while later in our hostel and I was experiencing a sharp stinging over most of my body and was glowing red from my face to waist and knees to toes. Only where my watch and shorts had been were saved but I was probably only a few more beers away from that too. After several cold showers and a nap I woke up feeling much, much worse - shivery, dizzy, ill and desperately thirsty. I pulled on some clothes *very* carefully and stepped out into the burning late afternoon heat in search of food and water.

The hostel had a large open area filled with long wooden tables and a restaurant/bar. They were pumping out dance music overhead to get everyone ready for the full moon party but it was empty except for the two of us and a table of five drinking and painting each other. There was no way I could make it to the full moon party in this state. I could hardly get any food down me but I couldn't slate my thirst. I couldn't really concentrate and wasn't far from fainting. I should have headed to bed. Or maybe to a hospital. But the music was egging me on and the table over looked like good people...

After a quick trip to 7/11 we were sat with the other travellers and I was equipped with another 4 litres of water, heaps of after sun and aloe vera gel, a sleeveless fluorescent top and several beers. My skin absorbed the after sun like a sponge and I was through the beer almost as fast. Suddenly I was starting to feel alot better.

On the night of every full moon Haad Rin beach is briefly populated by enterprising locals of various kinds, undercover police and thousands of tired and emotional tourists in fluorescent vests. 'FULL MOON PARTY HAAD RIN BEACH' is printed in fire from which strings of neon lights stretch down the beach past clubs booming dance music to a line of drunk men jumping over a flaming rope as it wooshes through the air. Stalls stretch down the beach each decorated with a different countries flag. Opposite them people people sat in circles or passed out on the sand. The ticket sellers had tried to mischange me on the way in but ended up giving me back too much money when we confronted them. Rather than waste it we visited Ireland were the owner made some pouring motions behind the stall so we couldn't see and brought out a bucket that apparently contained a vodka lemonade. Walking further down the beach we could see figures jumping the flaming rope. One figure tripped and fell under it. Unable to get out from under the rope quick enough they were caught a few times before scrambling away inciting a sympathetic 'aah'-ing  from the crowd but then quickly forgotten.

The rope was put away and replaced by a ring attached by a rope at each end, held up and lit on fire. Fumes poured off it and into the night sky. A few hundred people crowded around the fire keeping a respectful distance from the heat. Every now and then someone would muster the confidence to sprint out from the crowd and dive through. We must have looked like members of some lost fluorescent tribe, performing some ancient ritual to prove our courage. We started at the edge of the crowd but slowly, crept closer to the front. Almost unwillingly pulled towards the flames. My heart was pounding as I arrived at the leading edge. All eyes were on the fire and whoever was running at it. There was a pause for a moment. I ran and jumped. I felt the heat brush over me as I passed through and landed - unburnt. *Phew*. Moments later Sam made it through too. 'Well', I thought, 'at least we don't need to do that again'.

The second time round we were a little more confident. We circled round back to the other side of the ring and waited for a space. This time Sam went first and ran towards the ring. As he jumped the rope was allowed to drop just a little. Sam fell into the burning ring of fire and went down, down, down hitting the bottom of the ring with his leg and dragging his arm through it as he went. 

I don't remember exactly what I said but it was something along the lines of: 'Ah. Bollocks.'.

### The clinc
A young woman was being rushed in on a stretcher. She had long blonde hair and pale skin decorated with fluorescent paints. She could have been anyone off the beach but she wasn't moving. The doctor picked up her head and shined a small bright torch into her eyes. Her head dropped limply as pushed her behind a curtain at the back of the clinic. With it's bright fluorescent lights and white decor it stuck out like a sore thumb against the colourful bars of the strip. It wasn't our first choice for where to spend the evening. It wasn't even our first choice of places to treat the burn. We'd tried to soothe it by washing it in an outside tap next to a pay to use toilet at first but the owner of the toilets had made us stop once they'd seen us. We found the clinic a little after with the help of some taxi drivers. People arrived with various ailments whilst we waited for someone to look at Sams burn. Some fairly serious, one just looking for a lost friend. When it was Sams turn it was just a few bandages and a bill and we were gone.

There's a sense of community in Thailand where everyone looks after each other. But your not part of the community and unless your Thai you can never be part of it. At the full moon party your not seen as a person, your just a pay cheque. Given the chance most will take advantage anyway they can. Someone will mischange you at the door. The drug dealers work with the cops to get their products back. Some of the people we saw on the beach passed out would have had their drinks spiked. I don't want to be unfair on Koh Phangan. We did meet locals on the island who were friendly and helpful. But they weren't at the full moon party that night.

### The morning after
The fire had aggravated the sun burn and my shoulders had developed stinging blisters. I alternated between feeling sorry for myself in the shower and in bed. First a long cold shower and then lieing with cold, wet towel compresses until those were stinging hot and then back in the shower taking the towels with me to cool them down again. Luckily Koh Phangan has several well stocked clinics on account of the many, many accidents that occur on the island so it was very cheap and easy to buy second degree burn cream which did help a little. But we still lived like vampires for the rest of our time on Koh Phangang. Cowering from the sun during the day in our air conditioned rooms only leaving to explore the town once it had cooled down in the evening.

The people we met outside of the party were friendlier than in Bangkok and seemed fairly normal. In the market, though you could still haggle on the prices I didn't feel like they were trying to rip me off so I usually didn't worry. We found a bar that we would spend the evenings in where we could turn up and play a few games of pool with the owner and some of the regulars. So despite the burning pain, Koh Phangang was on the whole a much more pleasant place to be than Bangkok.

The hostel we were staying in had been deserted after the full moon party so one morning I took several painkillers and hauled my backpack onto my blistered shoulders and we walked through the roasting sun to Smile Hostel which is a bit further out of town. The way there seemed mostly abandoned aside from the odd shop selling wine bottles filled with fuel for mopeds and dodgy massage parlours. Our hostel was well hidden down a dirt side track. The only giveaway was a sign with a disconcerting smiley face leaning out from down the road. Despite first impressions the hostel was pretty good. Clean with friendly owners, a remarkably chilled out dog and blessedly powerful air conditioning.

That evening once it had started to cool down we ventured out. We headed into town, had an excellent massaman curry from a restaurant on the high street, played some more pool and then started the long trek back. About halfway home as we were nearing the abandoned stretch we could hear the trembling tones of a Thai man singing badly into a mic. The kind of awful singing typical of a karaoke bar. The building was down a dirt road and was decorated with pink fairly lights and had a tall sign with text in Thai. Outside a few big jeeps were parked. It didn't look like your typical karaoke bar but the door pushed open without any resistance and we stepped through into a dimly lit room with a bar at the opposite end. I took a step towards the bar but stopped when I saw there wasn't anyone behind it. The wailing was louder in here but seemed to be coming from a speaker on the wall and as I looked around for a stage I only saw dozens of surprised Thai women staring at us. No one moved for a moment. We turned towards the door and the girls leaped to their feet to stop us. 'Don't go!' they said, 'Stay a while, have a drink - we'll show you a good time!'. Diving through the door we burst outside into the clear air with our money if not our dignity and walked away laughing. 

As it turned out the deserted street before our hostel was actually the red light district which creeks alive at night. It always appeared busy but it is mostly bored young Thai escorts with a scattering of odd older men lingering around buying them drinks. Pink fairly lights are hung outside all the bars wherever one might find a companion for the evening. We crossed through the district a few times and everytime I always heard that same Thai man singing.

After a few days with the sunburn my legs began to swell so much that my feet would fill my boots and I was unable to stand for long. My nipples would also slowly inflate as soon as I'd left the shower so that by the end of the day I'd developed a respectable pair of man boobs. If I'd done my hair right I may have even been able find employment in one of the cheaper bars but we were more pressed for time than money at this point and having run out of things to do at night on Koh Phangang we hid from the sun inside a boat to the mainland and flew north to Chiang Mai and shortly over to Pai.

## Pai
### A dirty business
There are two kinds of toilets in Thailand. There are your western style which is what we're used too. Big porcelain seat with a hole in the middle half filled with water. Then there are the squat toilets which are more like flat blocks of porcelain with slightly curved sides and a drain at one end. In south east Asia both types of toilets will have toilet paper and an odd looking water pistol hanging on the wall which up to now I'd figured was for cleaning the toilet. The toilets in Chiang Mai bus station are of the squat variety which I'd so far managed to avoid but as we arrived I'd realised that the late night out the previous night had put my stomach into a state of distress akin to the cold war - and things could go nuclear at any time. Worse there was no toilet paper or any sign there had ever been any toilet paper. I left, did some quick research and went back in. Crisis averted, I reached for the water pistol, the bum gun, and squeezed the trigger causing water to shoot out at an alarming rate. A very gentle touch resulted in a more approachable water stream, more like a tap than a firehose. I have to say it was an unusual experience but I did leave feeling squeaky clean.

### A slice of Pai
The road connecting Chiang Mai and Pai crosses over a mountain. On the way there it curves and drops like a rollercoaster track for two long hours. It's so bad that if you keep your eyes open you'll sometimes see signs for safe places to stop and vomit. The road is mostly only one car wide so at the hairpin corners the driver has to beep the horn to warn anyone coming down to stop. It's an uncomfortable journey but it's all worth it when you come rolling down through the outskirts of the town to see the sun set behind endless fields of rice. We rolled up a bridge and for a moment I could see into the fields where two farmers were toiling away in long clothes and pointed hats with round bases whilst far away a few lonesome trees stood watching them. 

Lit by the setting sun, the high street looked idyllic at first. Mopeds sort of dawdled down the street rather than darting and everything had a bit more room to breathe. I found a street food stand selling a delicious and massive piece of grilled chicken and decided I was going to like this place. Sadly like the chicken it couldn't last long and once the night came the high street filled up with stalls selling crepes, smoothies and random tat. More people arrived and the street quickly went from quaint to cramped.

Aswell as people and shops the high street is home to many dogs. General indifference towards animals has meant dogs probably first bought as guards or pets have bred and multiplied. Now there are many street dogs about who have had little or no friendly human contact. The ones that linger on the high street are usually safe if flea bitten. The problem is in the wider area where they form packs and roam about when it's cool out. After the high street started to fill up we left to find somewhere to eat a proper meal and see the end of the sunset. When we left it was pitch black and heading back we turned down a road with a little dog who yapped at us. Then another arrived, a bit larger and with flat tipped ears. Then soon six dogs of all different shapes and sizes were following us and growling, barking and nipping at our legs whilst we walked frantically away.

That said, most of the dogs I met were appreciative of a bit of human contact. I met one dog, white with a brown head and soft eyes, who after a few scratches behind the ear and a bit of attention happily slept at my feet for a while and tried to follow us home that night. I walked her back thinking that she must have been someones pet but when I went to the shop I'd met her at the owner looked at me like she'd just chased a rat outside I'd dragged it back in for her. She was a good dog but they're pests here not pets. She sat outside after that and watched me go but didn't follow me back again. It was probably for the best. I'd never have got her through customs.

### When I get my moped out on the road...
The attractions around Pai are well spread out so the typical thing to do is to rent a moped for a day or two and make your own tour. We'd been tempted to try it on Koh Phangang but had been put off by the high death rate. Pai was quieter but it still meant joining the stream of traffic that flows around the town and having never driven anything bigger than a go kart I was not confident. The whole walk there we were second guessing whether we should give it a go. At the rental office I just wanted to get on with it and go but the weather turned on us. We were sat opposite a girl from our hostel who was in crutches and had a bandaged face and arms after she'd flipped her moped over trying to avoid a dog. I was reminded of one guy we'd met who'd been put in a coma after an accident on a moped. Every third person seemed to have some sustained some sort of injury. I was close to wussing out when then the weather suddenly cleared up.

The two of us were balanced on the back of a moped and were driven down a muddy alley to a small house. A huge pig lay on it's side under a wooden shelter surrounded by strutting chickens. To the side of the house was a small paved area. We were shown how to start and stop the moped, where to put the fuel and drove a few unsteady circles around the paved bit each way. Driving test done we were let loose on the road. 

The first twenty minutes were nerve racking but once you get out of the town and away from all the traffic the mopeds were pretty easy to drive. Other than a minor incident were I drove into a ditch and ended up horizontally on a blind corner things went off without a hitch and they let us see the many splendid sights around Pai.

One of the spots I was excited to see was a small elephant centre. It's described in guides like a little old ladies house with some elephants nearby you can go and see and feed. When we rolled up a mahout was riding an elephant towards us. On it's back a carriage carrying two people rolled gently from side to side. At a distance it was a pretty majestic sight. Off the side of the road was a small enclosure. Two elephants stood nearby, sometimes shaking their heads from side to side but otherwise still. A woman was stood at the edge of the enclosure trying to lure an elephant over with a piece of fruit but it just stood and stared at her. A mahout inside saw what was happening and went over to the elephant. The man held out it's ear and held a cigarette lighter to it to drive the elephant firwards despite everyones protests. Then the elephant reached out without vigor and gently pulled the fruit out of the womans hand. It looked at us with big, hopeless eyes and passed the fruit too it's mouth. Unable to stand it we drove away.

### Laap
Before we left Pai I wanted to try some proper Northern Thai meals. Up north they like their meat. So much so that many of the traditional meals can be served cooked or raw for those who just can't wait. I'd had a glimpse of this with the chicken when I arrived but outside of one or two excellent street food stands, most of the high street sustenance is pretty poor or worse - vegetarian. The really good stuff is out of town. I read about Larp Khom Huay Poo online but it place took me nearly an hour to find and was so small I managed to walk past it once and then enter the wrong building on the second try. It's hidden out towards the air field and it's tiny menu consists of variants of the typical northern Thai dish and mythical meat salad Laap, a so spicy it'll make your eyes leak, pile of minced pork fried with mounds of fresh green herbs. It puts all other salads to shame and cost me around £2. It was glorious and a good meal to have in me as we prepared for the 762 turns once more.

## Chiang Mai
Back in Chiang Mai things were mostly as we had left them. Sheltered down a side street, Brick House hostel was an accident waiting to happen. It had three stories of rooms overlooking a swimming pool and a bar where whisky was cheaper than water. Behind the bar was run a slightly manic Thai man who laughed whenever he didn't understand what someone had said. Sadly he couldn't mix a simple drink and try as he might he would always end up making very fancy looking ones. Whatever you asked for he would always add a little extra flourish. It was a habit that drove one friend, who we'll call Scot, there mad as he always snuck a bit of lemon juice and a slice of lemon onto his SangSom (rum) and redbull. Yet whenever he complained about it the bartender just laughed and laughed.

### My 23rd Birthday

### A walk in a park
I'd always planned to ride an elephant once in Thailand but once we got here we found out about the breaking process where young elephants are removed from their family, tied up and tortured until their spirit is broken. What we'd seen in Pai just cemented the issue. But finding somewhere that respects and cares for the animals is not easy. Most camps use ethics to one up each other. You'll find leaflets all over Thailand featuring big 'No riding!' banners across them like it's a feature rather than a principle. None of them will tell you anything about what they are fed or where they sleep. In the end we went for the highest rated park on TripAdvisor and dropped £150 each on a day at Elephant Nature Park.

The arrival to Elephant Nature Park (ENP) was not as I had expected. The last stretch is along a dirt path through a dense jungle flanked by all kinds of riding camps, big and small, all cramped so tight together it's hard to say where one begins and the other ends. ENP is no exception. Our tour was actually in an adjacent camp that had previously been a riding camp but had converted to the ENP model.

We first saw the elephants that we'd be following through a wooden fence. There were two huge females, the mother and a nanny, and a young boy called Cookie who was just a little smaller than me. Just out of their reach sat several buckets of sliced pumpkin, watermelon and bannanas. The elephants stood, Cookie impatiently, and looked at us expectantly. Hesistantly I held out a chunk of pumpkin to the little guy who wrapped his long, dextrous trunk around the fruit, squeezing it as he did so that juices spilled out before passing it to his mouth and unrolling his trunk again ready to receive more. He ate so fast it took two people to keep him happy.

We were armed with a bandolier of fruit and sent through the fence to lead the elephants down towards the forest where they would be able to roam for a while. We walked ahead with the grown ups whilst Cookie followed behind chasing after a football, at least until he stepped on it and popped it like a grape, then he just followed the food again. At first it's intimidating being followed by an animal twice your size and hundreds of times your weight but it doesn't take long for you to acclimatise to them. Very quickly you find yourself strolling along besides elephants like it's the most ordinary thing in the world. So when someone said you can jump in the river after the elephants I ran at it and made a best effort to clear the bank. Then I turned around as the matriarch raised herself to her full height, slowly and with no effort but moving such a great mass that water poured off of her. She looked down at me curiously and I looked up in total awe at her sheer size. We stayed like that for the longest moment. Then she relaxed her head and broke the spell and was transformed back into your everyday two tonne land mammal.

Once we neared the end of the path the elephants split off and strolled through the thick foliage without us, their great mass allowing them to push through it with ease. After a moment a tremendous trumpeting noise echoed through the forest as they called to each other. We stopped, had some lunch by a waterfall and then turned about and headed back. Picking the elephants up again on the way back. 

After the walk we had a quick tour of the rest of the park and met some of the other elephants aswell as heaps of dogs - it was good to see some being properly cared for. It was an amazing experience and we could feel good about it too, confident that the elephants were being well looked after.

### Big Night Out
Back at the hostel I went and saw my favourite bartender and told him it was my birthday. He said he'd make something special. 15 minutes later he had constructed a pyramid six glasses high and poured several kinds of liquor into the bottom 6 before roasting some coffee beans and chucking those in too. More spirits were added at the top so that it flowed like a fountain down into the bottom glasses. Then he set the whole thing on fire. It was pretty impressive but the problem was it took him 20 minutes to set it all up and much longer to drink them so by the time we'd got them all down we only had a few hours before the curfew.

#### 22:00 - 2 hours till curfew
The 5 of us headed out - me, Sam, 'Scott' the Scottish expat and our local guide and two more friends we'd made on the trip. It seemed like your bog standard night club if a bit quiet. Dark, hot and sweaty with generic music pumping out from overhead. The club was empty at first but filled out faster than the free shots ran out leaving us stranded in a sea of people. After a few expeditions to the bar and back the lights were turned up and the music dimmed. I turned to the exit but everyone else was moving towards another open door that had been hidden in the dark till now.

#### 00:00 - Curfew
An uncharacteristically enthusiastic crowd rushed at the exit and the space and relatively cold air of the night only to find ourselves in a well lit cafe which happened to also sell drinks and play loud music. Scott was already at the bar, chatting up the bartender. Sam and the others had dispersed. There was an array of CCTV screens on the wall which caught my eye. In the middle we could see some confused looking stragglers in the now empty last room. On another police had just rolled up to the alley behind the club and were setting up a barrier. The police moved seamlessly from one screen to the other till they joined the stragglers and sent them out down the alley and into the street. I watched the door, waiting for the police to start knocking. But back on the CCTV they were packing up the barriers and driving away. So much for the curfew I suppose.

#### 02:00 - 2 hours after curfew
We left the cafe before it closed. Scott had spent all his money tipping the bartender so we headed out to find a cash point and whilst he thought of the next place to go. Some tuk-tuk drivers were still cautiously prowling the streets but other than that it was empty and eerily quiet. Scott swiftly led us to the next club a little further into the city. Inside was almost pitch black with the only light coming from the crazy disco lights that shone neon blue in random directions. Roaming around the club were silhouettes of wide men and the shapely outlines of women, the two confusingly melting into one in the strange light. It had been a long night and it was starting to get tiring. The lights flicked on. And I looked blearily around at a room filled with women of all kinds including many, many ladyboys. 

On our way out we were followed by a 5ft or so pretty, young woman who immediately tried to convince us to sleep with her. She held onto Sam and an other friends hand. The rest of us turned to leave but they were stuck. Her vice like grip held them into place and neither of them could get their hands free. Eventually she relented when the rest of us couldn't stop laughing. 

### YAMA - Yet Another Morning After
I stumbled downstairs and up too the bar in search of water but was offered a shot of a mysterious 'herbal remedy' instead which tasted strongly of whisky. But feeling a bit better I headed out the alley of our hostel. I passed through the steam from a noodle soup stand  set opposite a family who sat at a plastic table eating their breakfast. Flies buzzed faintly nearby. The smell of grilled pork drew me in down the street towards the best grilled meat in the city and finally out onto the main street where I tried unsuccesfully to take it all in. All the tall buildings and vehicles of unfamiliar shapes and the kind of plants you only see in garden centres at home. All too much for my slightly beer addled mind. Kitted out with a plastic bag of grilled pork and my laundry I set out to find someone who could wash it.

After half an hour of wandering around town unsuccesfully I came across a quiet bridge over a busy road. Halfway across lay a man. His skin tanned to leather from too many hours in the sun. His bare top showed his skin was pulled tight against his ribs. I couldn't tell if he was breathing. He had a small plastic watch on his wrist so I just kept walking. There was clearly something up. Further he was the only homeless person I'd seen since arriving in Thailand so somehow he must have managed to exclude himself from society. No one else was helping him so they likely knew something I didn't. It was a scam. I almost convinced myself enough to make it over the bridge. At the end of the bridge I turned back and folded a little money inside a t-shirt and left it by his head for if he woke up.

### Welcome to the jungle
Chiang Mai had one last surprise for us before we left. We'd arranged for a guide to lead us on a trek through a jungle north of the city. The hike had gone well. The route had winded past waterfalls, rice paddies and even through a small village. Torrents of rain had visited us with thunder echoing through the trees but had then left in an instant leaving the air clear and cool. 

Everything was going well till Sam mentioned that we'd been to Elephant Nature Park. Then our guide looked around conspiratorily before looking at us. He paused for a moment before continuing. He said that he'd worked their before leaving to start his own business and he'd seen the other side. He claimed the methods used to control the elephants at ENP were the same as at any other camps. And that it's success was because it had managed to capitalise on the idea of ethical practices without having to implement anything expensive. That the camp was too cramped for the number of elephants being kept there and that he'd seen elephants fight and die as a result and that elephants were being underfed but this was being hidden from tourists by regularly injecting them with growth hormones like you might cattle.

At first I rejected his comments out of hand. What he'd said seemed ridiculous... but there had been things that I'd tried to ignore. From the bus journey there till the moment we left they'd pushed their narrative hard. That the other camps were cruel and that ENP was making lives better for abused elephants. But they never explained how buying animals that cannot be used elsewhere prevents more from being broken into service. Ultimately they are profiting from the waste of other camps.

It was frustrating and embarassing that even when I'd stopped trusting anyone - to the point that I wouldn't risk helping a starving man in case it was a trick - I was still being caught out. I'd come expecting to learn more about Thai culture but it seemed like we'd mostly met liars. Thailand looked ruined by short sighted greed, corrupted by it and riddled with it and I was tired of it. And that could have been the end of it for me.

But then I found God.

### Chiang Khong
Before crossing into Laos we made one last stop. A one night stay in Chiang Khong to give us plenty of time for the crossing. Chiang Khong rests on the Thai/Laos border and it used to have the main river crossing for travellers looking to head into Laos. A bridge was built south of the town which allows cars and busses to cross the town and now most people will go straight across and never see Chiang Khong. Without any other tourist attractions, it is gradually fading back off the map. 

We stepped off the bus onto a grey and ugly high street. Stretching down it stood aging concrete hotels, thrown up in a hurry at one time and now left to rot. Further along the buildings were shorter so more light could get in and huge trees now outgrew the hotels they'd been planted near. We dropped our bags off at our hotel and found our way to 'The English bar'. It looked shut at first, but a locked door has never stopped Sam from a drink yet and he rolled open the gate and knocked on the windows and doors. Luckily for the door a man soon arrived on a moped and let us in. He was English but not the owner and gave us a free beer whilst we talked. Expat locals puttered in on their mopeds. Stopped for a drink before slowly heading on their way to nowhere in particular.

With other things to do that day the other Englishman eventually closed the bar, invited us back for the evening with the promise of free food and directed us around the corner to a hostel. The hostel was big and gaudy, the paint having faded a long while ago. A union jack was embedded in the wall. Inside newspaper, masking tape and trays of paint were scattered about. Opposite rows of chairs stood facing the building opposite protected from the sun by a pagoda. The hostel is run by God, a small gay Thai man, and his partner. Time was called on the work, chairs were found and warm beer was sold at a discount. It turned out to be a pretty good afternoon and we ended up spending a couple of days in Chiang Khong as a result. Just hanging around and watching the world drift by. It doesn't take long to warm to Chiang Khong. It's not a good place to do anything but it's a great place to do nothing. 

### Leaving
At 6AM the next day I got up so as not to waste the last day in Thailand. I borrowed a bike from the hostel and cycled the length of Chiang Khong from the royal portrait past the old port to where the road peters out to dirt and then back into town for a a bowl of spicy rice soup for breakfast. We'd stuck fairly rigidly to the tourist trail but we'd done alot and I'd enjoyed most of it. But I'd learnt alot too and though I'd like to say that our short stay in Chiang Khong entirely repaired my view of Thailand, it didn't. The tourism industry in Thailand is greedy and corrupt and without some major catastrophe that's not going to change. Chiang Khong was just a little reminder that some of the best experiences are the ones you didn't plan. So if we were really going to get the most from the rest of this trip we would need to venture off the beaten path to where we didn't know what to expect. And across the river, Laos waited.
