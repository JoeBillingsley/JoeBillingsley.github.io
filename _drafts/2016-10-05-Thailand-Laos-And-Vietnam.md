## Bangkok

### 'Frank'
We stepped off the airconditioned carriage of the airport rail link into a wall of hot, clammy air. The platform looked out onto a mess of buildings, some oozing moss and cracking from disrepair. Air conditioning units were placed carefully on every floor of every building. Tall trees with masses of soft leaves and rough scaly bark burst through the concrete below. 

We met 'Frank' under the platform smoking a cigarette next to an impassibly busy road. He was a short man with black hair and was dressed in the worn blue uniform of a skytrain employee. He was intensely friendly and asked a lot of questions. Where are you from? Is this your first day in Bangkok? Where are you staying? Within minutes of meeting him he'd retrieved a map from his back pocket and planned out our stay in Bangkok and onwards down to the full moon party in Koh Phangan. He even waved down a passing tuk-tuk to take us on a tour around the city.

He seemed dissapointed when we thanked him but declined the tour and asked if there was somewhere he would recommend for food at which he laughed and pointed across the road at a large open warehouse. Leaving Frank behind, we approached the river of metal three lanes wide that seperated us and a meal and waited for a clear moment to ford it.

And waited. And looked around for a crossing point.

And waited. And we must be missing something surely? The traffic never stop coming!

And then I gave up and asked Frank to help us cross the road.

Frank strode us across the traffic and up to a table. Fluorescent lights lit a wide room laid with a dirty concrete floor. A few stalls stood opposite a collection of white plastic tables and chairs. Noodles sizzled and cracked across the room. Hot oil spat furiously at meat and noodles. Spatulas scratched sharply on woks working to get every ounce of flavour out of the pan. He bought us each a tasty mess of soft noodles, ferociously spicy with an unexpectedly coarse texture - Pad Thai. He spoke about his interests - drinking, smoking, gambling and late nights out clubbing. He told us about working in Ireland and how cheap Thai prostitutes are compared to European ones. He even taught us the Thai words for 'hello', 'thank you' and 'big breasts'. He struck me as rather lonely.

After the meal and some more talk we headed outside. Frank reminded us again of the route he had planned out and pointed us to another tuk-tuk that had pulled over whilst we were talking. When we thanked him for the meal but declined again his demeanour cracked alarmingly. His smiling, friendly face had slipped into something equally intense but alot less friendly. Trying not to notice I just smiled, thanked him again and walked swiftly away. Moments later we were lost.

### Somewhere in Bangkok
The streets were wild and varied. Insulated wires hung like vines between concrete pylons in the street. Lanes of colourful traffic poured down wide roads. Agile motorbikes cut in front of their slower tuk tuk cousins which slowly forced their way though with horns blaring. Brightly coloured taxis stood at a standstill and the skytrain thundered overhead. The city felt overgrown with people.

When we finally got our bearings we found we were a long way from our hostel. I had no idea how to wave down a taxi but luckily the traffic was moving so slowly we had time to experiment. Catching a drivers eye and waving frantically did the trick and got us an overpriced trip to our hostel. We arrived, dumped our bags and retreated into our air conditioned room for a bit until the worst of the sun had passed.

### The Grand Palace
Elsewhere would have been clear blue sky but here the smog dirtied it grey. The hostel was clean with a large green area, good company and a well priced bar so it wasn't an easy decision to leave that morning but on balance it seemed necessary. We headed to one of the major tourist attractions nearby - the Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew. The first thing you see at the Grand Palace is the queue for tickets. From their your herded through the foreigner entrance where metal gates have been forced into an ornate arch.

Inside certainly looked impressive. Buildings were elaborately tiled and gilded. But despite it's attempts to blind you with glitz it lacked any presence. Bins were dotted around the area and signs direct you about. It was hard to see anything past selfie sticks and people and cameras. There were interesting murals towards the edge but no effort had been made to explain the story. Everything was pristinely painted and maintained but without any information it was hard to believe they were not just built for tourists to see. The palace was just a theme park of Thai architecture to gawk at and then leave, gaining little but spending money. We didn't even bother with the Wat Phra Kaew, we'd seen enough.

## Koh Phangang
Frank had told us something useful - if we got a sleeper train we could make it to the Thai islands in time for the legendary Full Moon party. We left Bangkok and settled in for a 12 hour stretch on a train.

### The boat
Palm trees, towns and villages whizzed by and the sun set and rose again. A tinny electric voice called out our stop and the train doors opened to a crowd of people offering lifts to the ferry. Tired and confused some of us departing were pulled away to unmarked minibuses. Around the corner an angry bus driver was screaming at a man that he was not a liar. We found a bus that had a name that matched our ticket, got on and hoped for the best.

It was a relief to see the pier but it was hours yet before the boat arrived. When we'd finally made it on board we'd been travelling for 15 hours and still had hours to go. Luckily the boat had a bar.

I bought a beer off the toothless man at the counter and, settling in for the long haul, slipped off my shoes. After the second beer I'd zipped my trousers off to shorts and at the fateful third or fourth I was shirtless. The sea was a stunning turquoise blue dopped with mountainous islands covered in lush green trees. The water invited you in and I couldn't wait to get to the island for a swim. The sun blazed on and the 4 hour boat journey slipped by in no time. Only when we landed did I remember that I hadn't put on any sun protection at all.

### The Full Moon party
A little while later in our hostel and I felt a sharp stinging over most of my body and I was glowing red from my face to waist and knees to toes. Only where my watch and shorts had been were saved. A few more beers and it could have been much worse. After several cold showers and a nap I woke up feeling awful - shivery, dizzy, ill and desperately thirsty. I pulled on some clothes *very* carefully and stepped out into the burning late afternoon heat in search of food and water.

The hostel had a large open area filled with long wooden tables and a restaurant/bar. It was empty except for the two of us and a table of five drinking and painting each other in preparation for tonight. Dance music pounded overhead whilst I ate a poorly prepared burger and chicken nuggets. There was no way I could make it to the full moon party now. I could hardly get any food down me. I should head to bed. Or maybe to a hospital. But the music was egging me on and the table over was having so much fun...

After a quick trip to 7/11 I was equipped with 4 litres of water, heaps of after sun and aloe vera gel and several beers. My skin absorbed the after sun like a sponge and I was through the beer almost as quick. I was actually starting to feel alot better...

On the night of every full moon Haad Rin beach is briefly populated by enterprising locals of various kinds, undercover police and thousands of tired and emotional tourists wearing fluorescent vests. 'FULL MOON PARTY HAAD RIN BEACH' was printed in fire from which strings of neon lights stretched down the beach past clubs booming dance music to a line of drunk men jumping over a flaming rope as it wooshed through the air. A collection of stalls stretched down 1/3 of the beach each decorated with a different countries flag. Ireland made some pouring motions behind the stall and brought out a bucket that satisfied the requirements of tasting vaguely alcoholic. Everything was going swimmingly but the lure of the fire games was pulled us in. 

A few hundred people crowded around the burning ring of fire keeping a respectful distance from the heat. The air was thick with the diesel fumes. Every now and then someone would muster the confidence to sprint out from the crowd and dive through. We must have looked like some lost fluorescent tribe. Like a late night kebab, jumping through a burning ring only seems like a good idea when your drunk. Unlike a dodgy kebab though this would hurt immediately rather than in the morning. But you don't get many chances to do something this stupid. The ring was held up by two men with a long rope and a little way off the ground, just big enough to pass it through if you tuck your head and legs in. My heart was pounding as I edged to the front. I remembered the sun burn, again too late. It was my turn. I ran at the loop. Jumped. Tucked. The heat brushed past me as I passed through and landed - unburnt. *Phew*. Moments later Sam made it through too. Hmm, now what... better go again!

The second pass we were more confident. Sam went first and made towards the ring. As he jumped the rope was pulled taught. He fell into the burning ring of fire and crashed through dragging his arm and leg through the fire as he went. 

I remember my exact thoughts: 'Ah. Bollocks.'.

### Some clinc
A young woman was rushed in on a stretcher. She wasn't moving. The doctor grabbed her head and shined a bright torch into her eyes as they pulled her behind a curtain at the back of the clinic. With it's bright fluorescent lights and white decor it stuck out like a sore thumb against the colourful bars. It wasn't our first choice for where to spend the evening. It wasn't even our first choice of places to treat the burn. We'd tried to soothe it by washing it in an outside tap at first but the owner made us stop once they'd seen us. We found the clinic a little after. When it was Sams turn, it was a few bandages and we were gone. I expect many others wouldn't be so lucky that night. We got a lift back with about 10 others in a pick up truck that was driving by. I shared a seat with a scouser who stood on his half and pushed his arse out of the window to save space. 

### The morning after
The fire had aggravated the sun burn. My shoulders had developed into stinging blisters. I rotated between cold showers and bed. A long cold shower and then 30 minutes of wet towel compresses and then back in the shower once those had started to heat up too much. 

We lived like vampires for the rest of our time on Koh Phangang, retreating from the sun during the day only leaving our air conditioned rooms once it had cooled down in the evening. The hostel we we're staying in had emptied out completely after the full moon party so one morning I took several painkillers and we carried our bags through the roasting sun and to another hostel a bit further out of town. Our hostel was past through a long residential area but there were no shops except some selling wine bottles filled with petrol. It was well hidden down a dirt side track and appearing someway from the nearest civilisation. The only giveaway was a sign with a disconcerting smiley face which leaned out from down the road on it which I'd ignored completely at first thinking it was for some dodgy drug den. Despite first impressions though the hostel was pretty good. Clean with friendly owners, a remarkably chilled out dog and some blessedly powerful air conditioning. 

The red light district on Koh Phangang is not impressive nor somewhere I think I'll visit again anytime soon. It's 99% bored young Thai women with a scattering of odd older men lingering around buying drinks. At night empty bars and massage parlours are lit up with pink fairy lights and pollute the night with music turned up so loud it's gone fuzzy. During the day it is a ghost town. To get from our hostel into town and back again you had to cross through the red light district dodging prostitutes, semi-feral dogs and drunk people on mopeds on the way.  

Once it started to cool down in the afternoon we headed into town, got some excellent curry a few drinks and played some pool before starting the long trek back. As we got nearer to our hostel we could hear the trembling tones of a Thai man singing very badly - karaoke! It was down another dirt road with a few big jeeps parked outside. I pushed open the door and stepped through into a dimly lit room with a bar at the front. It was small, much smaller than I was expecting for karaoke bar and there was no one at the bar. The wailing was louder in here but as I looked around for a stage I only saw around 20 surprised looking Thai woman staring at us. Then I noticed the music was being piped out of a speaker. A trap! I felt a bit like a rabit that had accidently walked into a cobras nest. For a moment we both just looked at each other in surprise. At once we both moved - me and Sam dived for the door as the girls jumped to their feet to stop us. Don't go - stay a while, buy a drink, play! We burst outside into the clear air with our money if not our dignity and walked away laughing.

We walked through the pink fairly-light district a couple more times before the sunburn caused my legs to swell so much that my feet filled my boots and standing for long periods became very sore. My nipples would also slowly inflate as soon as I'd left the cold shower so that by the end of the day I'd developed a respectable pair of man boobs. If I'd quoffed my hair correctly I may have even been able find employment in one of the cheaper bars but we were more pressed for time than money at this point and having run out of things to do on Koh Phangang we hid from the sun inside a boat to the mainland and flew north to Chiang Mai.

## Chiang Mai
Thailand hadn't been good at first impressions so far but by Chiang Mai it was definitely getting the hang of it. Surrounding the airport stretched rolling hills resting under the cover of clouds dyed gold by the setting sun. It was noticeably more laid back than anywhere else in Thailand so far - we were hardly even hassled as we left the airport.

## Pai
The food in Pai is fantastic. The night life is a bit shit. The street dogs are great but most of them would eat you given the chance and some make their own luck. 

TODO: Open and close with Frank. Reflect on Frank at the end.

    - I want people to understand the distance between a expat or traveller/tourist and the locals
        - Language barrier but also most people who speaks English are not trustworthy
        - People try and take advantage of you but they help their friends
        - Your a source of income so your not seen as a person in the same way. Your beef not cow.
        - Conflict with the people who do it. It's not in most peoples nature to be cruel so they abstract it out. 
    - Feel like you always have to be on guard. Out of place
        - If you stop for a moment to get your bearings or appreciate a view or even cross a road one of nearby drivers will notice and will pounce.
        - People notice you everwhere you go and try to take advantage
        - Overpriced 
        - Never felt quite so out of place as in Bangkok
    - How people further from the tourist trade do seem genuinely friendly
        - Street food vendors, ordinary people who make money from other means
        - And the people who see further and benefit from returning tourists
            - Hostel owners and restaurant


















Notes:
Walking around I kept seeing what looked like huge chunks of mango . The smell is like nothing else I've known. It sits in your nose for far longer than seems fair.

The smaller temples are better. A temporary refuge from the city. They are quiet and calm places. You still feel the weight of propriety. And it's appropriate that you should feel a bit cautious about how you dress or act. If no one holds it in any esteem the Wat Saket is just a big hill with a weird shaped rock on the top.

Thai funeral

Thai flags everywhere

The big things stay the same. But all of the little things are different.

It's not hard to get about but it can be expensive at first until you work out how much a taxi journey should really cost. Tuk tuks are an excellent mode of transport. Your standard tuk tuk is cobbled together out of 3 wheels, sheet metal and a car battery which is welded next the drivers feet and makes a distinctive 'putt-putt-putt' noise when it rus. Red and green lights above the driver convey some information that others ignore as your driver forces their way through the traffic. An ornate grill seperates you and the driver where you sit on padded seats with a surprising amount of head room. It's an exciting way to get around and an appropriate way to see the city.

People looked at you like a vending machine that might just drop two mars bars instead of one. Like you should pay more . There was a distance between . I understand where it came from. We're transient and we're priviliged.

We were frequently accosted by people trying to take us on 'tours' of the city and always they would ask is 'Is this your first day in the city'.

If Frank hadn't had taught us I wouldn't even be able to say 'hello' in Thai. But it was still unpleasent to be treated this way and as we retreated from the locals the gap grew ever wider.

Only parts of the city where it had been allowed to grow wild and where people actually lived interested me. In one place a river snaked past rows of houses stood like reeds and the frustrated traffic had quietened down to a distant hum. Smoke billows down the street from scrappy wheeled bbqs serving flowery white fish on long skewers and rows of sticky meat balls. People where sat by on plastic chairs, talking to each other and playing cards. Most took no notice of us as we passed by. Some just nodded and smiled.

I hadn't wanted to believe Frank was trying to scam us.

Bangkok is a poor first impression for Thailand. It trains you not to trust people and makes it harder to appreciate what you see. You start looking for scams everywhere. It's a shame as after Bangkok people became friendlier and kinder but the damage done in those first few days influenced much of my behaviour later into the trip.

Losing face.
