## Bangkok
We met 'Frank' smoking a cigarette under a bridge near a busy road. He was a short man with black hair and was dressed in a worn blue uniform. I was inclined to trust him. His uniform suggested he worked for the train company, he spoke English well and was carrying a map so I figured he must often deal with tourists. He was friendly, intensely friendly and asked a lot of questions. Where are you from? Is this your first day in Bangkok? Where are you staying? Within minutes of meeting him he'd mapped out our stay in Bangkok and onwards down to the full moon party in Koh Phangan. We were to rent a tuk-tuk to take us around the major attractions in the city and then speak to a travel information centre where the locals go who would help us organise a train in time for the party. He even waved down a passing tuk-tuk for us which kindly waited nearby. 

We started to walk away then hit the road. Vehicles streamed relentlessly in front of us. Cars trudged onwards whilst mopeds nimbly changed lanes and cut through the traffic. It was a river of metal and if we wanted lunch we somehow had to cross it. After staring around for a bit looking for some way to dam the stream we asked our old friend Frank for help. Frank strode out in front and parted the waves by stepping out in front of a van and holding his hand out toward it. 

Inside looked grim but smelt great. Fluorescent lights lit a wide room laid with a dirty concrete floor. A few stalls stood facing white plastic tables and chairs. Noodles sizzled and cracked across the room. Hot oil spat furiously at meat and noodles. Spatulas scratched on woks to get every ounce of flavour out of the pan and onto the plate. I stared some more - this time at the unfamiliar letters above the nearest stall. Frank saved us again, walked us to the nearest table and ordered us a tasty mess of soft noodles, ferociously spicy with an unexpectedly coarse texture - pad thai. Talking to Frank was less pleasant than adverts had described. He talked at us about his hobbies - drinking, smoking, gambling and late nights out clubbing. He was intimately familar with how much Thai prostitutes cost and was keen to share the information with us. He even taught us the Thai words for hello, thank you and big breasts.

About halfway through the meal Frank stopped us - 'How are you feeling? Do you feel ill?' he asked. I *was* feeling fine a moment ago, was that a little queasiness? Was I about to feel ill? Why would he even ask us that - wait had he put something in the food? I said I was feeling OK. 'Good' he said smiling, 'If you still feel OK in 30 minutes you will have a good time here. If you can eat street food, it will be very cheap'.

After the meal and some more chit chat we headed outside. Frank reminded us of the route he planned out and directed us to a tuk-tuk that had pulled over whilst we were talking. When we said that we would like to look around Bangkok ourselves first his demeanour cracked alarmingly. I pretended not to  otice and just smiled and thanked him and we walked away from the tuk tuk. Moments later we were lost.

The streets in Bangkok are wild and varied. Insulated wires hang like vines between concrete pylons in the street. Several lanes of colourful traffic pour down the wide roads and spill out onto the footpath. This is a city overgrown with people. Where it's left to grow wild I saw a market that disappeared down a train track. round roundabouts where the sprawl of the city has been held back to hold huge abstract sculptures.

It's not hard to get about but it can be expensive at first until you work out how much a taxi journey should really cost. Tuk tuks are an excellent mode of transport. Your standard tuk tuk is cobbled together out of 3 wheels, a sheet metal body and a car battery welded by the drivers feet that makes a distinctive 'putt-putt' noise when it rus. Red and green lights above the driver convey some information for others to ignore as your driver forces their way through the traffic. An ornate grill seperates you and the driver where you sit on padded seats with a surprising amount of head room. It's an exciting way to get around and an appropriate way to see the city.

When you find a clearing they feels artificial. The sprawl of the city has been pushed back often to craft a tourist trap. Perhaps a You feel even more exposed out here. Huge roundabouts with abstract statues on. 

The grand temples and palaces where more often flimsy relics of what they should be, the cultural or religious significance of the sites gutted by short sighted greed. The grand Wat Saket, a symbol of the city, houses a relic of the Buddha and has free high speed WiFi. The experience feels cheap and hollow. There is never any information to give depth to the structures and they are poorly treated.

Which meant the parts I enjoyed the most were the quiet backwaters where rivers snake through rows of houses and the frustrated traffic quietens down to a distant hum. Clumps of street food stalls are scattered about. Smoke billows out from simple charcoal bbqs cook meat pressed between two fine meshes. Whole flowery white fish are kept warm on long skewers next to rows of differently coloured sticky meat balls. People sat and talked to each other. Some played cards. No one really took any notice of you as you passed by. These places seemed more genuine and you could let your guard down for a little while. But you knew at the end of the road you'd meet another busy lane, soon another tourist trap and more people trying to seperate you from your money the best they can.

People looked at you like a vending machine that might just drop two mars bars instead of one. Like you should pay more . There was a distance between . I understand where it came from. We're transient and we're priviliged. 

If you spoke to anyone in a hostel you would always describe yourselves as 'travellers' and the people who lived their as 'the locals'. There's a weirdly colonial feel about it.

If Frank hadn't had taught us I wouldn't even be able to say 'hello' in Thai. But it was still unpleasent to be treated this way and as we retreated from the locals the gap grew ever wider.

In short I didn't like Bangkok and I was glad to leave. Luckily the start turned out to be the low point of the trip and from there things began to improve.

## Koh Phangang
We'd decided to follow some of Franks advice and head south to the Thai islands in time for the full moon party.

After the first beer I took off my shoes. By the second beer I'd unzipped my trousers too shorts and at the fateful third or fourth I was shirtless. Being drunk and British I decided that the 20 degree weather and occasional sunshine of home had adequately prepared my skin for a 4 hour boat journey in 30 degree weather and blazing sunshine. Hey, if the black American and the tanned to a crisp French guy can get away with it surely so can I! So I bought a few more singhas of the toothless man at the counter and settled in for the long haul, firmly convinced that I would have developed a glowing tan by the time we made it to Koh Phangang. When we landed about six beers in I was considering stripping down to my boxers and felt tingling all over. 

The ticket sellers tried to short me on the way in.

Frank wasn't the only one who tried to take advantage of us. Sam was less trusting than me and his mistrust saved us from the first few we met. After a few attempts you stop trusting anyone. 

## Chang Mai
The smaller temples are better. A temporary refuge from the city. They are quiet and calm places. You still feel the weight of propriety. And it's appropriate that you should feel a bit cautious about how you dress or act. If no one holds it in any esteem the Wat Saket is just a big hill with a weird shaped rock on the top.

Durian fruit. It's a bit like big chunks of mango. Bright yellow fruit in styrofome wrapped in plastic. Behind it sit piles of huge, spiky fruit. The smell is like nothing else I've known. It sits in your nose for far longer than seems fair.

## Pai
The food in Pai is fantastic. The night life is a bit shit. The street dogs are great but most of them would eat you given the chance and some make their own luck.

TODO: Open and close with Frank. Reflect on Frank at the end.
The big things stay the same. But all of the little things are different.
