A man walks down a quiet road. His heavy boots beat a hurried metronome. It is not a night to be out. Even the moon and stars have hidden behind thick cloud. The dim light of his phone barely revealing a metre ahead serves only to light his wisps of breath in the cold night. Behind something rustles in the hedgerow. He glances back to see...

*nothing.*

Slowly he becomes aware of a sensation. A certain weight on his shoulders. As though someone is reading over your shoulder. His ears sharp and exposed straining for any details. His hands curl to fists in his pockets.

He stops dead and turns defiantly. He casts the feeble light across the road. 

*nothing*

He paces. Faster now. The weight grows heavier. Hands on his shoulders. Ice in his chest. Climbing out his throat with every breath. His legs beg to run but he forces them steady. His heart beats twice for every step. His neck frozen forwards.

Ahead the safety of street lights. The promise of people pulling him in. Faster, faster out of the night.

To a train station. He barges through the wooden gate. It squeels in protest as it swings back. It's protests stopping too soon. The weight is a vice. Pressing down. Trying to force him to his knees. To **make** him look. 

The blare of a horn cuts the night air and the pressure eases. The train rumbles past and with a screech it slows down. A few bored faces slide by. The door opens agonisingly slowly. He steps inside and feels the weight evaporate from his shoulders. He shakes his head and catches a glimpse of a girl - and a smile. His neck melts as the doors shut tight behind him. The carriage shudders as the train took off and he turns to face the way he had come. 

*nothing*

He breathes a long deep breath. Turning to sit and he catches the girls pretty face, desperately trying to scream.
