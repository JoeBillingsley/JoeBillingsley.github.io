Optimising for:
    - Impact
    - Comfort
    - Value

Constraints
    - Clothing cannot be too formal or too casual

- The more formal you go the stricter the rules become
- Similarily, there is an expectation that your more formal clothing will be better quality and well maintained

    - Clothing is a means for others to identify you as one group or another
    - 

- At the other end of this you have workwear wherein its better if your clothes have been worn and tell their own story
- Workwear  sets of clothing are trying to communicate something different

- Fashion is an interesting mix of culture and something a bit more primal
    - Much of it is learned and culturally we can unlearn some of our lower level thinking also

- In terms of primal:
    - We communicate through facial expressions
        - Its disconcerting not to be able to see someones face or eyes
        - Shirts, jackets, tend to lead the gaze up to the face and frame it
    - Clothes tend to be designed so as to display the best parts of the person and hide or cover up the others 
        - Padded shoulders on blazers leading to a narrower
    - Not contrasting with our body

- Clothes don't make the man but they do introduce you.

- There was two things that were bugging me
    - I often didn't have the right outfit for a situation
    - I'd often run out of outfits whilst still having lots of clothes

- Visual interest
    - Contrast

- Proportion
    - 

- Skin colour
    - Indicates health

# Research

## Fit
- Clothing should 'outline the body without telling too many secrets, offering a flattering figure without emphasizing every curve and crevice'
    - From primer 
    https://www.primermagazine.com/2012/spend/how-a-shirt-should-fit-the-principles-of-fit

- Clothes look best when they echo the shape of the body underneath. When there’s too much fabric – or not enough – an outfit looks like it’s fighting the man inside, rather than flattering him
    - From Thread
    https://www.thread.com/gb/tips/men/issues/getting-clothes-mended-or-tailored/how-get-perfect-fit/

In all instances there should be some freedom of movement. You should be able to cross your arms, reach above your head, drop into a slavic squat etc without feeling constricted.

# TODO: Need to add notes on how styling affects formality
# TODO: Need references for this section.

- Blazer/Sports Jacket/Suit Jacket:
    The jacket should hug the body gently. Collar should rest against the shirt not press against it. The jacket should fasten just above the belly button. The hem should make it around halfway down your buttocks. A suit jacket should have sufficiently large sleeves to accomodate a shirt cuff with cufflinks. A jacket will almost always need tailoring. 

- Shirt:
    Seam should sit where the shoulder meets the arm. Should be able to fit about two fingers in the collar. Arm should reach just a little after the wrist on a formal shirt, shorter on a casual shirt. Anything else can be tailored.

- T-Shirt: 
    Same shoulder placement as the shirt. Length should finish around the middle of the trouser fly. Sleeve should end around the mid of the bicep.

- Trousers
    Sit comfortable around the waist with no belt. Should sit right on the actual waist (mid rise). On smart trousers the trousers should just touch the top of the shoe (no break) or a little lower (half break). Jeans/casual trousers should tend to sit a little higher (no break). Shorter lengths require more tapering to stay balanced.

- Shorts
    As with trousers but ending at the knee or a little higher.

- Outerwear
    Varies depending on the item. Shoulder should sit on the shoulder seam formed by the other layers. Sleeves should typically be long enough that they protect the underlying clothing

Finally clothes should be picked such that the fits approximately match with each other i.e. not a baggy shirt and slim fit trousers. On me that works out as slim/regular fit shirts and slim/straight fit trousers.

Oversized and undersized fits
- Not long ago the trend was towards progressively skinner clothes
- Now fashion seems to be heading in the other direction, towards relaxed and oversized clothes
- Since its probably going to swap again at some point or otherwise head in some over strange direction
- Sod all of that. I don't want to spend any more time thinking about clothing than I have to.

## Fabric
Fit may be king but fabric is where the true complexity lies

Best resource:
https://www.permanentstyle.com/the-guide-to-cloth

- Material
    - Cotton
        - Generalist material
        - Good at pretty much any temperature range material
        - Cheap due to mass production

        - Wrinkles
        - Can shrink when washed

        - Supima/Pima Cotton
            - Long staple fiber cotton
            - Supposedly stronger, softer and more colourfast 
            - https://supima.com/faq

    - Linen
        - Great for hot weather
        - 'Hygroscopic' tends to pull sweat off your skin
            https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258158332_The_Influence_of_Clothes_Made_from_Natural_and_Synthetic_Fibers_on_the_Activity_of_the_Motor_Units_in_Selected_Muscles_in_the_Forearm_-_Preliminary_Studies
        - Typically stronger than cotton allowing it to be thread into a more open weave 
            https://www.permanentstyle.com/2017/07/the-guide-to-summer-jacket-cloths.html

        - Tends to crease
        - Relatively uncommon so more expensive

        - Doesn't seem to be much in the way of grades of linen when it comes to clothing which simplifies things. 

    - Wool 
        - Great for cooler weather 
        - Can be made to be incredibly warm
        - The classic suit material
        
        - Moths will try to eat it
        - Can felt if not cared for properly
            - Heat and agitation (i.e. a tumble dryer or a hot washing machine) will cause felting
            - http://www.straw.com/cpy/wisdom/why_wool_felts.html
            - https://www.britishwool.org.uk/wool-felt

        - Very many different versions depending on the species/breed it comes from
            - Merino => Merino sheep
                - Very soft, warm and fairly breathable

            - Cashmere => Cashmere goats
                - Warmer than merino
                - Very expensive
                - Cashmere manufacturing is destroying parts of Mongolia
                    - https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/12/09/504118819/how-your-cashmere-sweater-is-decimating-mongolias-grasslands?t=1596388472770

            - Alpaca => ... 
                - Incredibly expensive
                - Apparently very soft

            - Common => Sheep
                - Lack of a better name
                - Quality of wool is measured by the size of the threads
                    - Smaller threads lead to a softer cloth
                    - However they also become less robust and require more careful treatment
                    - Past 160 there are diminishing returns

        - Different gauges of wool are common
            - High gauges (24-30) mean finer knits
            - Lower is typically chunkier knits
            - Lower/finer gauge doesn't necessarily mean better or worse quality
            - It is a better indicator of the size of the yarn used
            - It is more an indication of weight and temperature. Finer gauges will be lighter and typically cooler.

        - Worsted
            - Combed wool to create a smoother, glossier finish
            - Gets rid of the shorter staple fibers
            
            - Classic suit fabric
            - Usually fairly formal

            https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/worsted-wool-suiting-guide/

        - Carded
            - Keeps the shorter staple fibres
            - Rougher feel
            - Weaker fabric overall

        - Hot weather wool
            - High twist worsted wool is usually used for very smart outfits in hot environments
                https://www.permanentstyle.com/2019/07/a-guide-to-high-twist-bunches-2019.html
            - As best as I can tell, twisting the wool strengthens it allowing it for more open weaves to be used
                https://www.the-sustainable-fashion-collective.com/2014/08/28/twisted-fibres

- Synthetics
    - I don't care much about synthetic fibres outside of technical clothing
    - besides there are far too many of them to research it in depth. This link provids a decent guide:
        - https://sewguide.com/synthetic-fabrics-fibers/

    - The problem with synthetics is that it is hard to say if they are being included for their properties or as a cost saving measure
    - They have enough of a negative environmental impact that I wouldn't want to include them heavily in my wardrobe if I can avoid it

### Weaves
- There are three fundamental types of weave: plain, twill and satin.
- This isn't very helpful to know when you are browsing clothing.
- Satin weaves are so niche that I'm skipping them.

- Warp: Lengthways yarns. Stretched out on a loom.
- Weft: Top-to-bottom yarn. Threads in and out of the warp yarn.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft

The way the warp and weft yarns are threaded defines the weave.

- Open Weave vs Closed Weave
    - How tightly the threads are spun together
    - A more open weave will generally be cooler

- Lighter weights for hotter temperatures, heavier for hotter ones generally
    - Aim is to stop the clothing from sitting too heavily on your skin
    - Instead want something that the air can get in and around of
    - Breathability is more important which comes down to the weave

- Finally 'textured' clothes such as twills are generally less formal than 'crisp' clothes like poplin weaves

- As with fit, its important to consider whether the texture and sheen of the components of the clothes complement or contrast each other
    - Since texture and formality are closely linked it seems safer to go for similar textures/sheens so as not to have too much contrast overall

#### Plain
- Flat or checkboard appearance
- Simple in-and-out weave
- Generally heavier and warmer but not necessarily

- Poplin
    - Plain smooth fabric
        - Can be made lightweight making it good for warmer weather
    - Smart shirt fabric

    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide

- Oxford
    - Textured thicker fabric with very small square patterns
        - Basket weave, multiple weft threads cross over an equal number of warp threads
    - More casual shirts

    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide

- Seersucker
    - Lightweight puckered cotton
    - Wavy effect across the cloth
    - The idea is that most of the fabric is held away from the skin letting the heat dissipate and air circulate
        https://blog.samuel-windsor.co.uk/the-science-of-summer-dressing-to-keep-cool
    - Smart/casual for shirts/jackets/suits

- Hopsack
    - Similar weave to Oxford but very open
    - Light and airy so cool in the summer
        https://www.lanieri.com/blog/en/hopsack-fabric/

    - Delicate and sensitive to rubbing
        - Not a good fit for shirt/trousers but fine for jackets
        https://www.universaltailor.com/considering-a-hopsack-weave-in-your-tailored-suit/

    - Smart/casual jacket
    - Nice rough texture so pairs well with denim jeans

- Chambray
    - Heavier thread twill weave
    - Workwear (summer/autumn)
    - Coloured warp yarn and white weft one
    
    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide

#### Twill
- Diagonal appearance
- Typically more water resistant than plain weaves
    - Has fewer interlacings than a plain weave allowing the yarn to be packed more tightly together

- Twill
    - Similar to poplin 
    - Drapes better and resists creasing however less 'crisp' 
    - Travel shirts/everyday shirt

    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide#twill

- Denim
    - Twill weave with a heavier thread
    - Coloured (usually indigo) warp yarn and white weft one
    - Warmer than chambray (autumn/winter)
    - Workwear

    https://www.permanentstyle.com/2019/09/the-guide-to-denim-and-chambray-shirtings.html

- Flannel
    - Loosely woven, thick soft cotton or wool that can be brushed to add a fuzzy texture
        https://kirrinfinch.com/blogs/news/what-is-flannel
    - Basically very warm feel

    - Normally the yarns are dyed after 
    - With melange (mixed) flannel the unspun yarn is dyed instead
    - When put together it gives the flannel a bit more texture and depth 

    https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/flannel-guide-fall-fabric/

- Other variants:
    - Suit / jacket fabrics
    
    - Houndstooth / puppy tooth
    - Herringbone
    - Check

    - I like Birdseye
        - Micro spot texture, only really visible up close

## Colour
- Typically darker is more formal

Shoes
    I'm not in a hurry for any of these shoes so I'm picking out more aspirational shoes that I can save towards but will get a lot of use from. In a hurry, any high street stockist will sell most of these designs.

        - I bought a !Solid leather jacket several years ago
        - I bought a size larger so I could layer some softer clothes underneath and it serves this function very well
        - Its grown up into a very tough and reliable leather jacket

    - Sports jacket/Blazer
        - Tend to be on the casual end

        - Summer sports jacket
            - Unlined, linen hopsack, patch pockets

Suit 
    - If I am wearing a suit it is for a very specific purpose: either a wedding, funeral or interview
    - I'm not interested in taking any risks with my suit

    - In all cases:
        - Two button, single breasted, flap pockets, plain trousers, double vent, notched lapel
        - Ideally wool, working buttons, rayon (Bemberg silk) lining
        - Probably matching lining
        - Tailored -> Classic/Regular fit

    - Ideally high quality wool (merino, cashmere) but considering its mostly for layering cotton is fine

    - Two v-neck
        - The colours are difficult here
        - Might actually be possible to just have v-neck jumpers so long as the neck isn't too deep

    - Two crew neck
        - Light grey and black 

    - Half zip
        - Dark navy

Shirts
    - White poplin smart shirt

    - Three oxford cloth button downs
        - Too much of a meme not to try it
        - White, sky blue and a pale pink/salmon

        - Preferably soft collar rather than fused
        - Box pleat down the back for movement

        - Charles Tyrwhitt, TM Lewin, PINK Shirtmakers, Brooks brothers (absurd prices)

    - Two summer shirts
        - Oxford cloth is a bit heavier weight than ideal
        - I tend to run a bit hot

        - Both long sleeve
        - Linen / Seersucker shirts in relaxed colours
        
        - The classics are:
            - White linen
            - Blue and white striped seersucker

        - I grabbed both of these from John Lewis at steep discounts
        - They are both great in different ways.
            - If I'm stuck at a desk the seersucker seems to do a good job of absorbing sweat and keeping me comfortable
            - If I'm moving about the wind filters through the linen and seems somehow cooler than it should 

    - Two winter shirts
        - Ideally wool, flannel plaid shirts
            - Personally I like the 
        - Double up as an overshirt in autumn
        - Turns out that wool flannel shirts are very hard to find. Will be keeping an eye out for these.

        Varusteleka Särmä Wool Flannel Shirt,  

    - Two short sleeved shirts
        - Linen short sleeve
            - Linen blends just don't work as well

        - Next seem perfectly fine for this

    - Maybe:
        - Chambray shirt
            - You don't see these around very often but I like it

T-Shirts (x10)
    - Crew neck always
    - Ideally supima cotton
        - You pay 2-3x as much for knowing the cotton but considering plain t-shirts retail at around £5 its not the worst
    - The essential colours seem to be white, black, and navy
    - I'm overweighting white since I get a lot of wear from it

    - 3 white, 2 navy, 1 black
    - 1 green, 1 burgundy
    - Some others

Polo shirts (x3)
    - White and black
