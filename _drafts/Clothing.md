During the lockdown many people looked about themselves and realised they could not live comfortably surrounded by all of their stuff, all of the time. I instead experienced the opposite. As a student for a long, long time I've never had the money, or the space or the stability to accumulate much more than a ridiculous number of pint glasses. However, with nothing else to do, and the prospect of steep sales on the horizon, I started to think about changing that. It started with a rain coat. Before, when it rained - I just got wet. Now I had options. And this got me thinking: what else do I need - *actually need* - in my wardrobe?

Objective: To be well dressed for all situations

Well dressed:
    - Appropriate for the situation
        - Comfortable and practical 
        - but that also communicate the intended message (i.e. respectful, professional, approachable, practical etc)
        - With an eye for aesthetics

Formulation: Find the minimum number of items that allow for appropriate dress in all expected situations
- Constrained by budget, 

I did consider building a tool to help solve this problem. There are existing tools such as Thread \cite{}, _ \cite{} which intend to help solve the problem of being 'well dressed' (and make you buy things) but I have only ever found these to be suitable for idea generation. Clothing only has meaning in context. For a computer to understand the value of an item of clothing or the suitability of it for a certain situation, more or less requires it to learn a culture. I'm not interested in creating an artificial general intelligence at the moment, I'd just like a nice looking wardrobe. 

With an automated approach being nearly impossible I chose to solve this the old fashioned way. First, I learned everything I could about the topic. Then, I considered all of the different situations I can reasonably expect to encounter in the short term future. Finally, I picked out the minimum set of items I felt can be formed into appropriate outfits for the expected situations. This post is formulated in the same way. Section 1 brings together all of my notes on mens fashion aggregated from across the web. Section 2 briefly considers the expected situations and broadly categorises them. Finally, in Section 3 I select some clothing to form a target V1.0 of my wardrobe. 

Finally, before we begin it's worth pointing out that all of the information contained here has already been filtered through my own personal taste. If some piece of advice or information was intolerable to me (like oversized fits which I just don't understand) it will not be included in here. Hence, the output of this process is already tailored to me and my own interests and ambitions. Additionally, I am not an expert on the topic and whilst I have made an effort to find and reference authoritative sources wherever possible, I also have much more important things I should be doing. So TLDR: Take everything herein with a pinch of salt.

##     
- Items
    - Formality, fit and construction
- Fabric/Materials
    - Weaves, designs, quality
    - Leather grades, cuts
- Colour
    - Colour coordination and associations
- Communication
    - Intent, context, benefits
    - Range of acceptable outfits
    - In group and outgroup
    - Signalling, Veblen goods, conspicuous consumptions
        - This is how we end up with things such as watches costing millions (https://www.ablogtowatch.com/rarest-expensive-patek-philippe-watches/)
    - 
    - In practice, buying things is a very bad way of getting rich

### Items
- There are many 'rules' about how a certain item of clothing should fit or be worn. Probably these should only be taken as guiding heuristics and instead we should instead consider the fundamentals of proportionality, colour, texture, drape etc. Frankly though these are really hard things to learn so heuristics are fine for now.

Along the same line I should mention oversized/skinny fits. A while back the trend was towards progressively skinner clothes. Now I am told the wind is heading in the other direction, towards relaxed and oversized clothes. No doubt someone is making a lot of money from the apparently fickle nature of fashion. The most stable advice I can find seems to be the happy medium, tailored but not skin tight. Put nicely: 'Clothing should 'outline the body without telling too many secrets, offering a flattering figure without emphasizing every curve and crevice'
    - https://www.primermagazine.com/2012/spend/how-a-shirt-should-fit-the-principles-of-fit

The 'fits' I'm listing here are the most commonly recommended ones that I've come across. About as average as I can find on the internet. For expensive items like a suit or sports jacket it would make sense to work with a tailor (i.e. someone who knows what they are doing) to make sure it fits properly.

Finally, consider how clothes are going to look with each other. A baggy shirt and slim fit trousers can easily look like you've forgotten to do any washing. I prefer clothes that match my body shape, so on me that works out as slim/regular fit shirts and tapered/straight fit trousers.

#### Blazer/Sports Jacket/Suit Jacket
##### Fit:
The jacket should hug the body gently. Collar should rest against the shirt not press against it. The jacket should fasten just above the belly button. The hem should make it around halfway down your buttocks. A suit jacket should have sufficiently large sleeves to accommodate a shirt cuff with cufflinks. A jacket will almost always need tailoring. 

##### Construction
- Far more thought has gone into suit construction that I care to know. These are the most important parts I've come across:
    - Canvas / fusible inner
    - Shoulder padding
    - Interior lining
    - Lapel
    - Pockets
    - Button + button stance
    - Double / single breasted
    - Venting

- Canvassed / Fusible inner
    - Suit jackets need an interlining to provide the structure and shape of the jacket

    - Fused
        - Some fusible interfacing is glued to the suit fabric 

    - Full canvassed
        - Layer of horse hair/wool that is stitched loosely to the fabric and so can move fairly independently and move better with the user

    - Half canvassed
        - Canvassing is used in the important parts (chest/lapel) and the rest is fused

    Canvassed jackets vs Fusible:
        - Canvas lasts longer
        - Canvas drapes better
        - Canvas molds to the wearer over time
        - Canvas costs more
        - Canvas is heavier

    - Half canvassed is a fine compromise, compared to fully canvassed it is: 
        - Lighter
        - Cheaper
        - Won't drape quite as well

    In short, some form of canvassing is better.

    https://www.oliverwicks.com/article/half-vs-full-canvas

    Note: Canvas / Floating canvas are the same thing

- Shoulder padding
    - Shoulders are usually slightly padded to define the shoulders
    - Aim is usually to make the wearer look more traditionally masculine

    - Very broadly there are three weights:
        - Unstructured
            - Thin or no padding
            - Jacket sits naturally on shoulder
            - Works best on people with strong shoulders
            - Casual 

        - Light padding
            - The typical level of padding these days
            - Jacket follows shoulder but structures it neatly
            - Formal

        - Heavy padding
            - Rare, apparently a bit retro

    - If you already have big shoulders, you might want less padding so as to appear balanced and vice versa if you have smaller shoulders

    - Shoulder roping
        - The arm is attached slightly higher on to the suit to create a more defined/dramatic shoulder

    - Far more detail about suit shoulders is available online:
        https://parisiangentleman.co.uk/academy/signals-of-a-handmade-suit-a-shoulder-that-sings/
        https://www.michaelandrews.com/journal/shoulder-styles-guide

    - Note: good photo of british suit with straight shoulders 
    - Personally I like the classic british straight shoulder, very bond like
    - Adds just enough padding to follow the shoulder line 

- Lined/Unlined
    - The interior lining
    - Helps with putting the suit on and off
    
    - Traditionally silk but usually some form of synthetic these days. 'Bemberg Silk' is the cheaper and tougher alternative. 
        https://www.rampleyandco.com/blogs/the-journal/complete-guide-suit-jacket-linings

    - Can get suits without lining or only with some lining
        - Lined: Typical suit construction. Lining on all interior surfaces.
        - Half lined: No lining on the lower back
        - Quarter-Lined: No lining on the lower back or sides. 
        - Skeleton lined: No lining but with taped seams.
        - Unlined: No lining and folded and stitched seams
        https://dieworkwear.com/2016/03/16/different-ways-to-go-unlined/

    - Unlined jackets:
        - Are more casual
            - An unlined and un-padded jacket is closer to a shirt
                - About as casual as suits can go
                - Don't get any help from the suit anymore so may not suit everyone
        - Breath better making them better for hot weather
        - Can rub and catch on the shirt preventing it from sitting comfortably
            - As a result, even unlined suits will have lining in the sleeves so you can get your arm in and out without it catching on the shirt
            https://www.permanentstyle.com/2010/05/half-lined-and-unlined-jackets.html
        - Lose some of the important weight and structure given by the lining
            https://www.rampleyandco.com/blogs/the-journal/complete-guide-suit-jacket-linings
        - Cost more to do properly
        - May fail earlier without the protection of the lining
                https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/jacket-lining/

    - Quarter/Half lined jackets are more practical

- Pockets
    There are three that matter. In increasing orders of formality:

    https://blacklapel.com/thecompass/types-of-suit-pockets/

    - Patch pockets
        - A parch stitched on the side of the jacket for a pocket
        - As casual as a suit jacket can go

    - Flap pockets
        - Most common suit pocket
        - A pocket hidden inside the construction of the suit with a pocket flap covering it
        - Can tuck in the pocket flap to create something approximately like a welted pocket

    - Welted / Jetted pocket
        - Most formal
        - A flap pocket without the flap

    - Can get pockets cut straight or slanted
        - Straight is typical
        - Slanted was for easy access when horse riding
            - Not a common problem for most people these days
            - Apparently can help if want to appear a bit taller
                - https://blacklapel.com/thecompass/types-of-suit-pockets/

    Other things:
    - Breast pocket is usually welted but can get a patched version.
    - Can get a third pocket above one of the main pockets thats intended for carrying train tickets
        - More of a country than a business thing
    - If the pockets are sewn shut, cut them open
    - Don't put anything too heavy / sharp in the outside pockets. Apparently they aren't really meant to be used
        - https://blacklapel.com/thecompass/types-of-suit-pockets/
        - This seems pretty stupid to me but whatever

#### Shirt
##### Fit:

# TODO: this needs citations
    Seam should sit where the shoulder meets the arm. Should be able to fit about two fingers in the collar. Arm should reach just a little after the wrist on a formal shirt, shorter on a casual shirt. Anything else can be tailored,

    Length depends on purpose
    https://hespokestyle.com/dress-shirt-parts-terminology/
    https://propercloth.com/reference/the-perfect-dress-shirt/
        - Formal shirts are longer at the front and back to stay tucked in
        - Casual shirts are shorter and straighter 

    Off the rack shirts are made to fit as many people as possible which means the shirt can billow out a bit. Ideal shirt should minimise the excess fabric around the arm holes and the midsection.

##### Construction:

- Types of shirt size
    - Skinny, Slim,Tailored,Regular,Classic  

- Collar
    - Most shirt collars consist of a collar and a collar stand which supports the collar and is stitched to the shirt itself.
    - https://www.craftsy.com/post/sew-shirt-collar/
    - On more formal collars an interlining is added to give the collar some stiffness
        - The stiffness of this interlining determines the stiffness of the collar

    - Fused or stitched interlining
        - https://hespokestyle.com/dress-shirt-parts-terminology/
        - https://www.deoveritas.com/blog/fused-and-non-fused-sewn-collars/        
        - https://mensflair.com/fused-or-unfused-collars/ 
        - https://propercloth.com/reference/the-perfect-dress-shirt/

        - Fused collars are stiffer
        - Stitched is softer, usually more comfortable, may last longer
            - (more English apparently)
                - https://mensflair.com/fused-or-unfused-collars/
            - "The ironer needs to begin at the points and iron to the backside of the collar."
                - https://www.mytailor.com/manual/fused-vs-non-fused-collars-cuffs/

        - There are some conflicting ideas on which is more formal:
            - Fused is formal: 
                - https://propercloth.com/reference/the-perfect-dress-shirt/
                - https://www.deoveritas.com/blog/fused-and-non-fused-sewn-collars/
            - Stitched is formal:
                - https://mensflair.com/fused-or-unfused-collars/ 

        - All fused outside of made to measure / bespoke shirts

    - There are a many types of collar
            - http://hespokestyle.com/dress-shirt-collars-guide/
        - Largely determined by the distance between the two points of the collar

        Formal:
            - UK/Europe tend to be spread collars with a larger space between points 
            - Whilst in America its a point collar with points close to the tie
            - Key is just to keep it in proportion with yourself and the rest of the outfit
        
        - Casual shirts:
            - Button down collar 
            - Softer collars generally

- Yoke
    - The part on the back of the shirt, right under the collar

    - Two options:
        - Single yoke: All one piece of fabric
        - Split yoke: Two pieces of fabric joined at the middle

        - Material on the internet is confusing on this topic but split yoke generally wins
        
        - The obvious: A split yoke means you can make patterns on the shirt line up properly on the back of the shirt
        
        - Cutting on the bias means to cut fabric at 45 degrees to the grain
            - As best as I can tell: without the reinforcing structure of the warp/weft this allows the fabric to drape and stretch better 

        - https://propercloth.com/reference/ say:
            - A split yoke lets you stitch the yoke of the shirt on at an angle giving you better stretch across the back of the shirt
                - Think tying shoes

        - https://www.permanentstyle.com/2008/07/the-split-yoke.html say:
            - The front of the shirt will always be on the bias
            - If both the shoulder and the front are cut on the bias the seam between the two will be weak
            - A split yoke lets the tailor cut the front of the shirt and the shoulders at a different angle 
        
        - The strength argument makes some sense to me but I don't fully understand it. Its not clear to me why you need a split yoke to cut the yoke at an angle however as implied in the first argument.

- Placket
    - The front part the buttons go on

    https://propercloth.com/reference/dress-shirt-front-placket-types/

    - Plain placket:
        - The standard folded back placket you see on most shirts
        - Can be made with a fusible interlining
    
    - French placket
        - No placket, buttons just connect the two parts of the shirt

    - Covered placket / Fly front:
        - Like a plain placket with another piece of fabric that covers up the buttons

- Cuffs
    - Like the placket and collar, can be made stiff or soft depending on if its fused or stitched 
    
    - Few different kinds of cuff:
        - Barrel cuff
            - The basic shirt cuff

            - One button is standard
            - Two button is either:
                - more formal (apparently)
                https://propercloth.com/reference/dress-shirt-cuff-styles/
            
                - more casual and should only be worn with one button undone
                https://www.apposta.com/sp/guides/types-of-cuff.3sp

            - Available in rounded, straight or mitred cuts
                - Straight and rounded are general purpose

                    https://propercloth.com/reference/dress-shirt-cuff-styles/

        - French cuff
            - Cufflinks cuff
            - Most formal

        - Convertible cuffs
            - French cuffs and barrel cuffs combined
            - Very flexible

- Hem
    - Finishing along the bottom of the shirt
    - Good quality shirts will have a little triangle bit of reinforcing fabric (a gusset) to strengthen the side seams

- Pleats / Darts
    - Pleats
        - Add and hide excess material to improve the wearers range of movement
        - In particular movements that stretch the back
            - Think doing up shoe laces
        - Adds extra material to the waist
            https://www.burton.co.uk/blog/anatomy-of-a-shirt/

        - Box pleats
            - Casual
            - Folded box on the back of the shirt

            https://www.burton.co.uk/blog/anatomy-of-a-shirt/
            https://artofstyle.club/pleats-on-dress-shirts/

        - Side pleats / knife pleats
            - More formal pleat
            - Subtle pleats near the shoulder blades below the yoke

                https://www.burton.co.uk/blog/anatomy-of-a-shirt/
                https://artofstyle.club/pleats-on-dress-shirts/
                
        - No pleats
            - Most flexible but hardest to achieve
            - According to some sources, a well fitted shirt shouldn't need pleats
                https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mens-dress-shirts/
                https://artofstyle.club/pleats-on-dress-shirts/

    - Darts
        - Fold and stitch in part of the shirt to remove excess fabric and tailor it slimmer to the wearers body
        - Done at a tailors
        - Wouldn't usually have darts and pleats in the same shirt

#### T-Shirts
##### Fit:
- T-Shirt: 
    Same shoulder placement as the shirt. Length should finish around the middle of the trouser fly. Sleeve should end around the mid of the bicep.

##### Construction:

#### Trousers
##### Fit:
Sit comfortable around the waist with no belt. Should sit right on the actual waist (mid rise). On smart trousers the trousers should just touch the top of the shoe (no break) or a little lower (half break). Jeans/casual trousers should tend to sit a little higher (no break). Shorter lengths require more tapering to stay balanced.

#### Construction
- Trousers

    Trouser pockets:
    https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/pockets-complete-guide/

#### Shorts
##### Fit:

- Shorts
    As with trousers but ending at the knee or a little higher.

#### Construction:

#### Outerwear
##### Fit:
Varies depending on the item. Shoulder should sit on the shoulder seam formed by the other layers. Sleeves should typically be long enough that they protect the underlying clothing

#### Construction:
- Outerwear
    - Raglan vs set in sleeve
        - https://www.cherrytreecountryclothing.com/expert-advice/difference-between-raglan-sleeve-and-set-in-sleeve/


#### Belts
Belts are fairly easy. There are only a few 'rules' to know:
- https://www.ties.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-belts
- https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mans-guide-belts/
- https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-men-belts-guide/

- Match leathers and match metals
    - The leather of the belt should be near to any other leathers you are wearing e.g. shoes. Quality shoe companies tend to also sell belts for this exact reason.
    - The metal of the belt should be the same metal as any other metals e.g. watch.
        - But break this rule if you want to

- More formal belts are:
    - Around 1.25" wide 
    - Leather
    - Plainer
    - Glossier
    - Thinner

- In the opposite direction, casual belts are:
    - 1.5" - 1.75"
    - Leather still \aside{Fabric belts look stupid. This is a hill I'm willing to die on.} 
    - More decorative
    - Matte 
    - Thicker

- The ideal belt will be cut such that the spare leather is only long enough to tuck through the first belt loop or so

#### Watches
- Types of movement:
    - Quartz
        - Solar, battery
    - Manual
    - Automatic

- Water resistance:
30m / 3 bar - Splash proof
50m / 5 bar - Swim proof
100m / 10 bar - Water activities proof
200m+ / 20 bar - Serious diving watch

- Magnetic resistance
If a mechanical watch is exposed to a magnetic field, parts can become magnetised that can intefere with the accuracy of the movement. This can be avoided by buying a cheap quartz watch or an anti-magnetic watch. Magnetic field  strength is measured in guass. 1000 gauss or above is effectively resistant to all magnetic fields you will encounter but watches are available with up to 15,000 gauss resistance (Omega Aqua Terra). In 2016 an Omega prototype (https://monochrome-watches.com/the-prototype-seamaster-that-omega-tested-at-insane-160000-gauss/) was shown to remain accurate after being exposed to 160,000 gauss. If for some reason you want to take your watch into the large hadron collider, give them a call.

- Shock resistance
Most watches are not designed to handle abuse and will require a bit of coddling. This includes any activities with sudden movements i.e. sports. Many watches are at least shock resistant, specifically they can be dropped from a metre onto a hardwood floor and still remain functional and accurate (https://www.iso.org/standard/62753.html). For more intense activities, watches in the Casio G-Shock series and some Timex and Luminox watches are designed to be all but indestructable.

- Sizing
    TODO
    - Lug to lug width
    - Case height

- Maintenance costs
    - A quartz watch requires minimal maintenance outside of battery replacement
        - For watches with a high water resistance this requires specialist tools to ensure that the seal has been formed correctly
    - Mechanical watches require regular maintenance
        - https://blog.toolwatch.io/watch-tips/watch-servicing-guide/
        - Over time, parts wear away and damage each other. To prevent the internal parts from accruing too much damage, watches need to be serviced regularly
        - A watch service requires complete dissambly, then cleaning and reoiling each component and replacing any worn components
        - Obviously this can get very expensive         
            - For luxury watches this cost can be on the order of £500-1000
            - For cheaper watches it may be cheaper to replace them
        - Typically a watch should be serviced every 3 - 5 years

- Overall:
    - Quartz watches are by far the most cost efficient and practical
    - However, there is something special about having such an intricate mechanism on your wrist
        - Some mechanical and automatic watches are beautiful
        - Moreso, the movement on a watch is a human scale level of complexity
        - A simple casio watch with multiple functions is orders of magnitude more complex than a mechanical watch but it happens on a level that we cannot really appreciate it
    - Heritage and story

    - The second thing to consider is the signalling quality of an expensive watch
        - Luxury watch brands such as Omega and Rolex are a Veblen good, they are valuable because they are expensive and because others know they are expensive
        - A luxury watch implies the wearer has attained some level of success in the past
        - If you're trying to convince others that you will be succesful in the future as well then this could be a useful tool 

#### Glasses/Sunglasses


### Communication
- The more formal you go the stricter the rules become
- Similarly, there is an expectation that your more formal clothing will be better quality and well maintained

    - Clothing is a means for others to identify you as one group or another
    - 

- At the other end of this you have workwear wherein its better if your clothes have been worn and tell their own story
- Workwear  sets of clothing are trying to communicate something different

- Fashion is an interesting mix of culture and something a bit more primal
    - Much of it is learned and culturally we can unlearn some of our lower level thinking also

- In terms of primal:
    - We communicate through facial expressions
        - Its disconcerting not to be able to see someones face or eyes
        - Shirts, jackets, tend to lead the gaze up to the face and frame it
    - Clothes tend to be designed so as to display the best parts of the person and hide or cover up the others 
        - Padded shoulders on blazers leading to a narrower
    - Not contrasting with our body

- Visual interest
    - Contrast

- Proportion
    - 

- Skin colour
    - Indicates health

# Research
## Fabric
Best resource:
https://www.permanentstyle.com/the-guide-to-cloth

- Material
    - Cotton
        - Generalist material
        - Good at pretty much any temperature range material
        - Cheap due to mass production

        - Wrinkles
        - Can shrink when washed

        - Supima/Pima Cotton
            - Long staple fiber cotton
            - Supposedly stronger, softer and more colourfast 
            - https://supima.com/faq

    - Linen
        - Great for hot weather
        - 'Hygroscopic' tends to pull sweat off your skin
            https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258158332_The_Influence_of_Clothes_Made_from_Natural_and_Synthetic_Fibers_on_the_Activity_of_the_Motor_Units_in_Selected_Muscles_in_the_Forearm_-_Preliminary_Studies
        - Typically stronger than cotton allowing it to be thread into a more open weave 
            https://www.permanentstyle.com/2017/07/the-guide-to-summer-jacket-cloths.html

        - Tends to crease
        - Relatively uncommon so more expensive

        - Doesn't seem to be much in the way of grades of linen when it comes to clothing which simplifies things. 

    - Wool 
        - Great for cooler weather 
            - Moisture wicking so can be made appropriate for the summer if not too thick
                - www.baavet.co.uk/benefits-of-wool
        - Can be made to be incredibly warm
        - The classic suit material
        
        - Moths will try to eat it
        - Can felt if not cared for properly
            - Heat and agitation (i.e. a tumble dryer or a hot washing machine) will cause felting
            - http://www.straw.com/cpy/wisdom/why_wool_felts.html
            - https://www.britishwool.org.uk/wool-felt

        - Very many different versions depending on the species/breed it comes from
            - Merino => Merino sheep
                - Very soft, warm and fairly breathable

            - Cashmere => Cashmere goats
                - Warmer than merino
                - Very expensive
                - Cashmere manufacturing is destroying parts of Mongolia
                    - https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/12/09/504118819/how-your-cashmere-sweater-is-decimating-mongolias-grasslands?t=1596388472770

            - Alpaca => ... 
                - Incredibly expensive
                - Apparently very soft

            - Common => Sheep
                - Lack of a better name
                - Quality of wool is measured by the size of the threads
                    - Smaller threads lead to a softer cloth
                    - However they also become less robust and require more careful treatment
                    - Past 160 there are diminishing returns

        - Different gauges of wool are common
            - High gauges (24-30) mean finer knits
            - Lower is typically chunkier knits
            - Lower/finer gauge doesn't necessarily mean better or worse quality
            - It is a better indicator of the size of the yarn used
            - It is more an indication of weight and temperature. Finer gauges will be lighter and typically cooler.

        - Worsted
            - Combed wool to create a smoother, glossier finish
            - Gets rid of the shorter staple fibers
            
            - Classic suit fabric
            - Usually fairly formal

            https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/worsted-wool-suiting-guide/

        - Carded
            - Keeps the shorter staple fibres
            - Rougher feel
            - Weaker fabric overall

        - Hot weather wool
            - High twist worsted wool is usually used for very smart outfits in hot environments
                https://www.permanentstyle.com/2019/07/a-guide-to-high-twist-bunches-2019.html
            - As best as I can tell, twisting the wool strengthens it allowing it for more open weaves to be used
                https://www.the-sustainable-fashion-collective.com/2014/08/28/twisted-fibres

- Synthetics
    - I don't care much about synthetic fibres outside of technical clothing
    - besides there are far too many of them to research it in depth. This link provides a decent guide:
        - https://sewguide.com/synthetic-fabrics-fibers/

    - The problem with synthetics is that it is hard to say if they are being included for their properties or as a cost saving measure
    - They have enough of a negative environmental impact that I wouldn't want to include them heavily in my wardrobe if I can avoid it

### Weaves
- There are three fundamental types of weave: plain, twill and satin.
- This isn't very helpful to know when you are browsing clothing.
- Satin weaves are so niche that I'm skipping them.

- Warp: Length ways yarns. Stretched out on a loom.
- Weft: Top-to-bottom yarn. Threads in and out of the warp yarn.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft

The way the warp and weft yarns are threaded defines the weave.

- Open Weave vs Closed Weave
    - How tightly the threads are spun together
    - A more open weave will generally be cooler

- Lighter weights for hotter temperatures, heavier for hotter ones generally
    - Aim is to stop the clothing from sitting too heavily on your skin
    - Instead want something that the air can get in and around of
    - Breathability is more important which comes down to the weave

- Finally 'textured' clothes such as twills are generally less formal than 'crisp' clothes like poplin weaves

- As with fit, its important to consider whether the texture and sheen of the components of the clothes complement or contrast each other
    - Since texture and formality are closely linked it seems safer to go for similar textures/sheens so as not to have too much contrast overall

#### Plain
- Flat or check board appearance
- Simple in-and-out weave
- Generally heavier and warmer but not necessarily

- Poplin
    - Plain smooth fabric
        - Can be made lightweight making it good for warmer weather
    - Smart shirt fabric

    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide

- Oxford
    - Textured thicker fabric with very small square patterns
        - Basket weave, multiple weft threads cross over an equal number of warp threads
    - More casual shirts

    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide

- Seersucker
    - Lightweight puckered cotton
    - Wavy effect across the cloth
    - The idea is that most of the fabric is held away from the skin letting the heat dissipate and air circulate
        https://blog.samuel-windsor.co.uk/the-science-of-summer-dressing-to-keep-cool
    - Smart/casual for shirts/jackets/suits

- Hopsack
    - Similar weave to Oxford but very open
    - Light and airy so cool in the summer
        https://www.lanieri.com/blog/en/hopsack-fabric/

    - Delicate and sensitive to rubbing
        - Not a good fit for shirt/trousers but fine for jackets
        https://www.universaltailor.com/considering-a-hopsack-weave-in-your-tailored-suit/

    - Smart/casual jacket
    - Nice rough texture so pairs well with denim jeans

- Chambray
    - Heavier thread twill weave
    - Work wear (summer/autumn)
    - Coloured warp yarn and white weft one
    
    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide

#### Twill
- Diagonal appearance
- Typically more water resistant than plain weaves
    - Has fewer interlacings than a plain weave allowing the yarn to be packed more tightly together

- Twill
    - Similar to poplin 
    - Drapes better and resists creasing however less 'crisp' 
    - Travel shirts/everyday shirt

    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide#twill

- Denim
    - Twill weave with a heavier thread
    - Coloured (usually indigo) warp yarn and white weft one
    - Warmer than chambray (autumn/winter)
    - Workwear

    https://www.permanentstyle.com/2019/09/the-guide-to-denim-and-chambray-shirtings.html

- Flannel
    - Loosely woven, thick soft cotton or wool that can be brushed to add a fuzzy texture
        https://kirrinfinch.com/blogs/news/what-is-flannel
    - Basically very warm feel

    - Normally the yarns are dyed after 
    - With melange (mixed) flannel the unspun yarn is dyed instead
    - When put together it gives the flannel a bit more texture and depth 

    https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/flannel-guide-fall-fabric/

- Other variants:
    - Suit / jacket fabrics
    
    - Houndstooth / puppy tooth
    - Herringbone
    - Check

    - I like Birdseye
        - Micro spot texture, only really visible up close

## Colour
- Typically darker is more formal

# Situations
Smart: Funerals, wedddings, interviews, important work situations
Smart casual: Conferences/business events, posh nights out, posh meals, day to day work, work drinks
Casual: Every day uniform, standard nights out, holiday clothing, beach trips, heavy nights out, 'invisible' outfit, handle anything outfit, lounging
Active wear: Swimming, running, cycling
Hobbies: Horse riding, hiking, travelling, labouring

# TODO: Discuss contrast in terms of formality e.g. suit jacket and shorts.

# Formal
## Essential
Formal dress, to my mind, means a suit. A more general description would be anything were the clothes you are wearing are meant to imply a certain degree of respect for the event you are attending. There are four events you absolutely need a suit for. In decreasing order of enjoyability these go: weddings, interviews, funerals, black tie events. Fortunately, it seems like you only really need two suits to cover these four very specific situations. 

By definition a suit has low contrast between components so instead it derives visual interest from the pattern, texture and the sharp contrast between the colour of the suit and the typically white shirt. To my mind, most patterns come across as either business suits or, for lack of a better word, a bit wankery, so I've not considered those in my selection. 

For very formal events, funerals and black tie events, there is an unwritten dress code that simplifies things greatly. For the lower end of formality, the weddings and interview, I'm opting to introduce some visual interest through simple textures. In all instances I'm looking for classic English details and fairly basic choices. That is: If I'm wearing a suit to an event, I'm probably not looking to stand out.

In total I'm after two suits and a few extra details.

# TODO: Do outfits first then items
# e.g. Interview: dark navy suit + white twill shirt + quartz watch + black toe cap oxfords
# ... The weather is also changeable in the UK so it is important to have some additional items for cold and wet weather: an umbrella and an overcoat. 
# then go into details on each item

### Dark Navy Suit
- Either a plain weave or a simple textured weave that appears solid across a room
    - e.g. twill, birdseye, houndstooth, pin and pull (?)
- This keeps the suit a little less formal but still sharp enough that it is suitable for job interviews

- Super 100s worsted wool
    - Supposedly 120-160s is a good range for smart suits
        - https://www.montagio.com.au/cms/picking-the-perfect-suit-fabric-weave
    - Really depends on price

Jacket:
- Single breasted
- Two button
- Double vent
- Straight shoulder
- Flap pockets
- Notched lapel
- Probably a natural/neutral button stance
    - Has the top button sit at the thinnest part of the waist
    - Pretty much at the belly button
- Ideally dark, Bemberg silk lining
- Ideally functional buttons

White twill shirt
- Nice to introduce a little pattern in
- A white poplin would also be fine and works with both suits
- Probably spread collar

Trousers:
- Matching jacket
- Half break
- Side adjusters

Tie
- Navy grenadine tie

### Black Suit
- Plain weave

Jacket + Trousers
- As above

Shirt:
- White poplin cotton shirt
- Most likely a spread collar but depends on the proportion of the suit

These two core suits can then be modified slightly to be tailored more specifically to each event:

### Weddings
Navy suit + Waistcoat + Derby shoes

Waistcoat
- Single breasted, probably five buttons, no lapel
- This will only be turning up at weddings so could potentially introduce some contrast here to tone down the formality of the outfit a little
    - Contrasting colour (dark grey?) or a simple pattern possibly

Dark brown derby
- Light brouging
- Rubber soled so that I don't have to worry about falling over on the dance floor at the after party

- $$$$ https://www.johnlobb.com/en_gb/mens-shoes/croft-double-leather-sole


- Barker Bailey
- Loake 1880 Wembley

- I wouldn't want to wear a nice watch to an event which usually turns into a very dressed up night club

- Black socks
    - Silk ideally
    - At least one pair of solid black socks

### Interviews
Navy suit + No Waistcoat + Black Toe Cap Oxfords + Business / Navy Grenadine tie

Black toe cap oxford
- Its plain toe or toe cap and plain toe would just not get enough wear
- So ubiquitous that they don't say anything at all

- Clarks Oliver Limit / Jones's Goodyear Welted Oxford
- Crockett & Jones Audley, Edward Green Chelsea

Cheap quartz Watch
- I like wearing a watch as a rule and an interview is one situation where its very useful to know the time

- A fancy dress or sports watch attempts to communicate success
- When I graduate I will be applying to graduate positions so this just comes across as presumptuous or possibly foolish
- The image I will be trying to communicate is of efficient professionalism
- A simple metal quartz watch such as the Casio A158W seems much more in line with this presentation
    - It helps that it reads as a bit nerdy as well
- For higher level positions it makes more sense to have a fancier sports watch

Business tie
- Simple navy or red diagonal tie

### Funeral
Black suit + Black silk tie + Oxfords

Black oxfords
- Ideally, black plain fronted whole-cut oxford
- Otherwise toe cap is also fine
- Less detailing the better
    - https://www.crockettandjones.com/collections/mens/oxfords/alex-black-calf/

Black silk tie

### Black tie
Technically this is an outfit for a black tie *optional* event but given the number of times I expect to be invited to one of these I don't think its worth putting too much thought into it.

Black suit + Navy tie + Dress watch + Oxfords

Black oxfords
- As for the funeral shoes but well shined

Tie
- Navy grenadine tie

Dress Watch
- That said there are some really nice dress watches about... 
    - Steel
    - Thin enough to slip under a shirt cuff
    - Ideally rectangular
    - Ideally mechanical or automatic

- £ Orient Bambino
- £ Seiko SUP880P1

- ££ Junghans Max Bill
- ££ Longines DolceVita

- £££ Jaquet Droz
    - Ceramic, automaton bloke
- £££ Grand Seiko, Hermes
- £££ Jaeger-LeCoultre
    - Reverso
- £££ Cartier Tank

For wet/cold situations:
- Black umbrella
- Black wool overcoat
    # TODO: Details

# Smart Casual
Smart-casual is for those slightly confusing transitional events where its not quite a suit but something more than jeans and a t-shirt. This category can accommodate some nicer items that need a bit more looking after. This is already a much less prescriptive area than properly smart clothing so there is an opportunity to introduce a bit more variety. 

The level of formality I am aiming for here is that everything could go with a pair of dark indigo jeans.

From the formal section I'm stealing the brown derbies and the black overcoat. The suits and ties are far too smart for this category.

For more formal situations the sports jackets will carry the outfit.

## Tailoring
- Navy sports jacket
    - Wool or a cotton/wool mix
        - A thicker wool adds some texture and stops it from looking like a lost suit jacket
    - Flap pockets
    - Single breasted
    - Lined

- Linen sports jacket
    - Bright blue or cream
    - Hopsack weave
    - Quarter lined or fully unlined
    - Patch pockets
    - Single breasted

    - Hopsack has an nice open weave that works well with the linen to keep cool in hot weather. There's no point having a breathable outer if there is a layer of lining covering it up so unlined is essential.

## Shirts
- White + Sky blue + Pale pink oxford cloth button down
    - Generic workhorse shirts that complement the other colours
    - Have to be careful with the pink as my skin will burn even when exposed to particularly bright lamps

    - Preferably soft collar rather than fused
    - Box pleat down the back for movement
    - Informal details
        - # TODO
    - Should be untuckable for when not wearing a jacket

    - Charles Tyrwhitt, TM Lewin, PINK Shirtmakers, Brooks brothers (absurd prices)

- Summer shirts
    - Long sleeve
    - Linen or seersucker
    - So far I've found seersucker to be a better material
        - Interesting texture by default
    - Linen shirts are often cut quite loose which looks a bit too informal

## Trousers
- Stone/Wheat chinos
    - Colour wise I'm looking for something cooler / more towards the grey end 
        - I considered grey itself but it tends to look too washed out in the pictures I've seen so far
    - Linen or light weight cotton
    - Belt loops, mid rise, plain, twill weave
    
    - Gant Regular Twill Chino

- Dark indigo jeans
    - Not too similar in colour to the navy jacket
    - Possibly selvedge
        - Selvedge denim requires a fair bit of work to wear properly
        - Formal clothing means it can't be too faded

## Shoes
- Chelsea boots
    - Tricky one
    - Probably brown
        - Black seems a little hard to fit into the more casual outfits
        - Redder tones look good but are a bit limiting
    - Maybe suede
        - Suede requires a bit more care to look after and doesn't age very well
    - Flat rubber sole, ideally dainite or similar, leather upper

    - ££ Thursday boots
    - £££ Bexley Enfield
    - £££ RM Williams Craftsman/Signature Craftsman

## Outerwear
- V-neck jumpers
    - Ideally high quality wool
    - V-neck jumpers present the shirt collar better than crew neck ones
        - Fairly shallow v though still
    - Fairly neutral colours that can work under any outfits
        - Bright blue and dark grey

- Peacoat / Bridge coat
    - 

## Accessories
- Sports watch
    - Blue or black dial
    - Round
    - Steel
    - Ideally automatic
    - 100m+ water resistance

    - £ Casio Edifice
    - ££ Seiko SARX045
    - ££££ Omega Seamaster
    - ££££ Rolex Explorer

- Dark brown belt
    - Leather matching the derby shoes and/or the chelsea boots

## The 'maybe' pile
- Tan oxford brogues
    - Dark brown derbies might look be a bit too formal for some situations
    - Can only find out once I've picked up some more important parts

- Specialised chinos
    - Stone/Wheat goes well with both jackets but its a mid weight cotton isn't perfectly comfortable in either hot or cold conditions
        - Grey wool trousers
            - Seem popular on the internet, never noticed them in the wild
        - Stone/Wheat/White chinos
            - Lightweight cotton or linen
