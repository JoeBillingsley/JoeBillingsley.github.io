During the lockdown many people looked about themselves and realised they could not live comfortably surrounded by all of their stuff, all of the time. I instead experienced the opposite. As a student for a long, long time I've never had the money, or the space or the stability to accumulate much more than a ridiculous number of pint glasses. However, with nothing else to do, and the prospect of steep sales on the horizon, I started to think about changing that. It started with a rain coat. Before, when it rained - I just got wet. Now I had options. And this got me thinking: what else do I need - *actually need* - in my wardrobe?

Objective: To be well dressed for all situations

Well dressed:
    - Appropriate for the situation
        - Comfortable and practical 
        - but that also communicate the intended message (i.e. respectful, professional, approachable, practical etc)
        - With an eye for aesthetics

Formulation: Find the minimum number of items that allow for appropriate dress in all expected situations
- Constrained by budget, 

I did consider building a tool to help solve this problem. There are existing tools such as Thread \cite{}, _ \cite{} which intend to help solve the problem of being 'well dressed' (and make you buy things) but I have only ever found these to be suitable for idea generation. Clothing only has meaning in context. For a computer to understand the value of an item of clothing or the suitability of it for a certain situation, more or less requires it to learn a culture. I'm not interested in creating an artificial general intelligence at the moment, I'd just like a nice looking wardrobe. 

With an automated approach being nearly impossible I chose to solve this the old fashioned way. First, I learned everything I could about the topic. Then, I considered all of the different situations I can reasonably expect to encounter in the short term future. Finally, I picked out the minimum set of items I felt can be formed into appropriate outfits for the expected situations. This post is formulated in the same way. Section 1 brings together all of my notes on mens fashion aggregated from across the web. Section 2 briefly considers the expected situations and broadly categorises them. Finally, in Section 3 I select some clothing to form a target V1.0 of my wardrobe. 

Finally, before we begin it's worth pointing out that all of the information contained here has already been filtered through my own personal taste. If some piece of advice or information was intolerable to me (like oversized fits which I just don't understand) it will not be included in here. Hence, the output of this process is already tailored to me and my own interests and ambitions. Additionally, I am not an expert on the topic and whilst I have made an effort to find and reference authoritative sources wherever possible, I also have much more important things I should be doing. So TLDR: Take everything herein with a pinch of salt.

##     
- Items
    - Formality, fit and construction
- Fabric/Materials
    - Weaves, designs, quality
    - Leather grades, cuts
- Colour
    - Colour coordination and associations
- Communication
    - Intent, context, benefits
    - Range of acceptable outfits
    - In group and outgroup
    - Signalling, Veblen goods, conspicuous consumptions
        - This is how we end up with things such as watches costing millions (https://www.ablogtowatch.com/rarest-expensive-patek-philippe-watches/)
    - 
    - In practice, buying things is a very bad way of getting rich


### Items

## Fit
- Clothing should 'outline the body without telling too many secrets, offering a flattering figure without emphasizing every curve and crevice'
    - From primer 
    https://www.primermagazine.com/2012/spend/how-a-shirt-should-fit-the-principles-of-fit

- Clothes look best when they echo the shape of the body underneath. When there’s too much fabric – or not enough – an outfit looks like it’s fighting the man inside, rather than flattering him
    - From Thread
    https://www.thread.com/gb/tips/men/issues/getting-clothes-mended-or-tailored/how-get-perfect-fit/

In all instances there should be some freedom of movement. You should be able to cross your arms, reach above your head, drop into a slavic squat etc without feeling constricted.

# TODO: Need to add notes on how styling affects formality
# TODO: Need references for this section.

- Blazer/Sports Jacket/Suit Jacket:
    The jacket should hug the body gently. Collar should rest against the shirt not press against it. The jacket should fasten just above the belly button. The hem should make it around halfway down your buttocks. A suit jacket should have sufficiently large sleeves to accomodate a shirt cuff with cufflinks. A jacket will almost always need tailoring. 

- Shirt:
    Seam should sit where the shoulder meets the arm. Should be able to fit about two fingers in the collar. Arm should reach just a little after the wrist on a formal shirt, shorter on a casual shirt. Anything else can be tailored.

- T-Shirt: 
    Same shoulder placement as the shirt. Length should finish around the middle of the trouser fly. Sleeve should end around the mid of the bicep.

- Trousers
    Sit comfortable around the waist with no belt. Should sit right on the actual waist (mid rise). On smart trousers the trousers should just touch the top of the shoe (no break) or a little lower (half break). Jeans/casual trousers should tend to sit a little higher (no break). Shorter lengths require more tapering to stay balanced.

- Shorts
    As with trousers but ending at the knee or a little higher.

- Outerwear
    Varies depending on the item. Shoulder should sit on the shoulder seam formed by the other layers. Sleeves should typically be long enough that they protect the underlying clothing

Finally clothes should be picked such that the fits approximately match with each other i.e. not a baggy shirt and slim fit trousers. On me that works out as slim/regular fit shirts and slim/straight fit trousers.

Oversized and undersized fits
- Not long ago the trend was towards progressively skinner clothes
- Now fashion seems to be heading in the other direction, towards relaxed and oversized clothes
- Since its probably going to swap again at some point or otherwise head in some over strange direction
- Sod all of that. I don't want to spend any more time thinking about clothing than I have to.

#### Belts
Belts are fairly easy. There are only a few 'rules' to know:
- https://www.ties.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-belts
- https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/mans-guide-belts/
- https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-men-belts-guide/

- Match leathers and match metals
    - The leather of the belt should be near to any other leathers you are wearing e.g. shoes. Quality shoe companies tend to also sell belts for this exact reason.
    - The metal of the belt should be the same metal as any other metals e.g. watch.

- More formal belts are:
    - Around 1.25" wide 
    - Leather
    - Plainer
    - Glossier
    - Thinner

- In the opposite direction, casual belts are:
    - 1.5" - 1.75"
    - Leather still \aside{Fabric belts look stupid. This is a hill I'm willing to die on.} 
    - More decorative
    - Matte 
    - Thicker

#### Watches
- Types of movement:
    - Quartz
        - Solar, battery
    - Manual
    - Automatic

- Water resistance:
30m / 3 bar - Splash proof
50m / 5 bar - Swim proof
100m / 10 bar - Water activities proof
200m+ / 20 bar - Serious diving watch

- Magnetic resistance
If a mechanical watch is exposed to a magnetic field, parts can become magnetised that can intefere with the accuracy of the movement. This can be avoided by buying a cheap quartz watch or an anti-magnetic watch. Magnetic field  strength is measured in guass. 1000 gauss or above is effectively resistant to all magnetic fields you will encounter but watches are available with up to 15,000 gauss resistance (Omega Aqua Terra). In 2016 an Omega prototype (https://monochrome-watches.com/the-prototype-seamaster-that-omega-tested-at-insane-160000-gauss/) was shown to remain accurate after being exposed to 160,000 gauss. If for some reason you want to take your watch into the large hadron collider, give them a call.

- Shock resistance
Most watches are not designed to handle abuse and will require a bit of coddling. This includes any activities with sudden movements i.e. sports. Many watches are at least shock resistant, specifically they can be dropped from a metre onto a hardwood floor and still remain functional and accurate (https://www.iso.org/standard/62753.html). For more intense activities, watches in the Casio G-Shock series and some Timex and Luminox watches are designed to be all but indestructable.

- Sizing
    - Lug to lug width
    - Case height

- Maintenance costs
    - A quartz watch requires minimal maintenance outside of battery replacement
        - For watches with a high water resistance this requires specialist tools to ensure that the seal has been formed correctly
    - Mechanical watches require regular maintenance
        - https://blog.toolwatch.io/watch-tips/watch-servicing-guide/
        - Over time, parts wear away and damage each other. To prevent the internal parts from accruing too much damage, watches need to be serviced regularly
        - A watch service requires complete dissambly, then cleaning and reoiling each component and replacing any worn components
        - Obviously this can get very expensive         
            - For luxury watches this cost can be on the order of £500-1000
            - For cheaper watches it may be cheaper to replace them
        - Typically a watch should be serviced every 3 - 5 years

- Overall:
    - Quartz watches are by far the most cost efficient and practical
    - However, there is something special about having such an intricate mechanism on your wrist
        - Some mechanical and automatic watches are beautiful
        - Moreso, the movement on a watch is a human scale level of complexity
        - A simple casio watch with multiple functions is orders of magnitude more complex than a mechanical watch but it happens on a level that we cannot really appreciate it
    - Heritage and story

    - The second thing to consider is the signalling quality of an expensive watch
        - Luxury watch brands such as Omega and Rolex are a Veblen good, they are valuable because they are expensive and because others know they are expensive
        - A luxury watch implies the wearer has attained some level of success in the past
        - If you're trying to convince others that you will be succesful in the future as well then this could be a useful tool 

#### Glasses/Sunglasses


### Communication
- The more formal you go the stricter the rules become
- Similarily, there is an expectation that your more formal clothing will be better quality and well maintained

    - Clothing is a means for others to identify you as one group or another
    - 

- At the other end of this you have workwear wherein its better if your clothes have been worn and tell their own story
- Workwear  sets of clothing are trying to communicate something different

- Fashion is an interesting mix of culture and something a bit more primal
    - Much of it is learned and culturally we can unlearn some of our lower level thinking also

- In terms of primal:
    - We communicate through facial expressions
        - Its disconcerting not to be able to see someones face or eyes
        - Shirts, jackets, tend to lead the gaze up to the face and frame it
    - Clothes tend to be designed so as to display the best parts of the person and hide or cover up the others 
        - Padded shoulders on blazers leading to a narrower
    - Not contrasting with our body

- Visual interest
    - Contrast

- Proportion
    - 

- Skin colour
    - Indicates health

# Research
## Fabric
Fit may be king but fabric is where the true complexity lies

Best resource:
https://www.permanentstyle.com/the-guide-to-cloth

- Material
    - Cotton
        - Generalist material
        - Good at pretty much any temperature range material
        - Cheap due to mass production

        - Wrinkles
        - Can shrink when washed

        - Supima/Pima Cotton
            - Long staple fiber cotton
            - Supposedly stronger, softer and more colourfast 
            - https://supima.com/faq

    - Linen
        - Great for hot weather
        - 'Hygroscopic' tends to pull sweat off your skin
            https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258158332_The_Influence_of_Clothes_Made_from_Natural_and_Synthetic_Fibers_on_the_Activity_of_the_Motor_Units_in_Selected_Muscles_in_the_Forearm_-_Preliminary_Studies
        - Typically stronger than cotton allowing it to be thread into a more open weave 
            https://www.permanentstyle.com/2017/07/the-guide-to-summer-jacket-cloths.html

        - Tends to crease
        - Relatively uncommon so more expensive

        - Doesn't seem to be much in the way of grades of linen when it comes to clothing which simplifies things. 

    - Wool 
        - Great for cooler weather 
        - Can be made to be incredibly warm
        - The classic suit material
        
        - Moths will try to eat it
        - Can felt if not cared for properly
            - Heat and agitation (i.e. a tumble dryer or a hot washing machine) will cause felting
            - http://www.straw.com/cpy/wisdom/why_wool_felts.html
            - https://www.britishwool.org.uk/wool-felt

        - Very many different versions depending on the species/breed it comes from
            - Merino => Merino sheep
                - Very soft, warm and fairly breathable

            - Cashmere => Cashmere goats
                - Warmer than merino
                - Very expensive
                - Cashmere manufacturing is destroying parts of Mongolia
                    - https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/12/09/504118819/how-your-cashmere-sweater-is-decimating-mongolias-grasslands?t=1596388472770

            - Alpaca => ... 
                - Incredibly expensive
                - Apparently very soft

            - Common => Sheep
                - Lack of a better name
                - Quality of wool is measured by the size of the threads
                    - Smaller threads lead to a softer cloth
                    - However they also become less robust and require more careful treatment
                    - Past 160 there are diminishing returns

        - Different gauges of wool are common
            - High gauges (24-30) mean finer knits
            - Lower is typically chunkier knits
            - Lower/finer gauge doesn't necessarily mean better or worse quality
            - It is a better indicator of the size of the yarn used
            - It is more an indication of weight and temperature. Finer gauges will be lighter and typically cooler.

        - Worsted
            - Combed wool to create a smoother, glossier finish
            - Gets rid of the shorter staple fibers
            
            - Classic suit fabric
            - Usually fairly formal

            https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/worsted-wool-suiting-guide/

        - Carded
            - Keeps the shorter staple fibres
            - Rougher feel
            - Weaker fabric overall

        - Hot weather wool
            - High twist worsted wool is usually used for very smart outfits in hot environments
                https://www.permanentstyle.com/2019/07/a-guide-to-high-twist-bunches-2019.html
            - As best as I can tell, twisting the wool strengthens it allowing it for more open weaves to be used
                https://www.the-sustainable-fashion-collective.com/2014/08/28/twisted-fibres

- Synthetics
    - I don't care much about synthetic fibres outside of technical clothing
    - besides there are far too many of them to research it in depth. This link provids a decent guide:
        - https://sewguide.com/synthetic-fabrics-fibers/

    - The problem with synthetics is that it is hard to say if they are being included for their properties or as a cost saving measure
    - They have enough of a negative environmental impact that I wouldn't want to include them heavily in my wardrobe if I can avoid it

### Weaves
- There are three fundamental types of weave: plain, twill and satin.
- This isn't very helpful to know when you are browsing clothing.
- Satin weaves are so niche that I'm skipping them.

- Warp: Lengthways yarns. Stretched out on a loom.
- Weft: Top-to-bottom yarn. Threads in and out of the warp yarn.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft

The way the warp and weft yarns are threaded defines the weave.

- Open Weave vs Closed Weave
    - How tightly the threads are spun together
    - A more open weave will generally be cooler

- Lighter weights for hotter temperatures, heavier for hotter ones generally
    - Aim is to stop the clothing from sitting too heavily on your skin
    - Instead want something that the air can get in and around of
    - Breathability is more important which comes down to the weave

- Finally 'textured' clothes such as twills are generally less formal than 'crisp' clothes like poplin weaves

- As with fit, its important to consider whether the texture and sheen of the components of the clothes complement or contrast each other
    - Since texture and formality are closely linked it seems safer to go for similar textures/sheens so as not to have too much contrast overall

#### Plain
- Flat or checkboard appearance
- Simple in-and-out weave
- Generally heavier and warmer but not necessarily

- Poplin
    - Plain smooth fabric
        - Can be made lightweight making it good for warmer weather
    - Smart shirt fabric

    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide

- Oxford
    - Textured thicker fabric with very small square patterns
        - Basket weave, multiple weft threads cross over an equal number of warp threads
    - More casual shirts

    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide

- Seersucker
    - Lightweight puckered cotton
    - Wavy effect across the cloth
    - The idea is that most of the fabric is held away from the skin letting the heat dissipate and air circulate
        https://blog.samuel-windsor.co.uk/the-science-of-summer-dressing-to-keep-cool
    - Smart/casual for shirts/jackets/suits

- Hopsack
    - Similar weave to Oxford but very open
    - Light and airy so cool in the summer
        https://www.lanieri.com/blog/en/hopsack-fabric/

    - Delicate and sensitive to rubbing
        - Not a good fit for shirt/trousers but fine for jackets
        https://www.universaltailor.com/considering-a-hopsack-weave-in-your-tailored-suit/

    - Smart/casual jacket
    - Nice rough texture so pairs well with denim jeans

- Chambray
    - Heavier thread twill weave
    - Workwear (summer/autumn)
    - Coloured warp yarn and white weft one
    
    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide

#### Twill
- Diagonal appearance
- Typically more water resistant than plain weaves
    - Has fewer interlacings than a plain weave allowing the yarn to be packed more tightly together

- Twill
    - Similar to poplin 
    - Drapes better and resists creasing however less 'crisp' 
    - Travel shirts/everyday shirt

    https://www.batchmens.com/pages/dress-shirt-fundamentals-shirt-fabrics-and-weaves-guide#twill

- Denim
    - Twill weave with a heavier thread
    - Coloured (usually indigo) warp yarn and white weft one
    - Warmer than chambray (autumn/winter)
    - Workwear

    https://www.permanentstyle.com/2019/09/the-guide-to-denim-and-chambray-shirtings.html

- Flannel
    - Loosely woven, thick soft cotton or wool that can be brushed to add a fuzzy texture
        https://kirrinfinch.com/blogs/news/what-is-flannel
    - Basically very warm feel

    - Normally the yarns are dyed after 
    - With melange (mixed) flannel the unspun yarn is dyed instead
    - When put together it gives the flannel a bit more texture and depth 

    https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/flannel-guide-fall-fabric/

- Other variants:
    - Suit / jacket fabrics
    
    - Houndstooth / puppy tooth
    - Herringbone
    - Check

    - I like Birdseye
        - Micro spot texture, only really visible up close

## Colour
- Typically darker is more formal

# Situations
Smart: Funerals, wedddings, interviews, important work situations
Smart casual: Conferences/business events, posh nights out, posh meals, day to day work, work drinks
Casual: Every day uniform, standard nights out, holiday clothing, beach trips, heavy nights out, 'invisible' outfit, handle anything outfit, lounging
Active wear: Swimming, running, cycling
Hobbies: Horse riding, hiking, travelling, labouring

# TODO: Discuss contrast in terms of formality e.g. suit jacket and shorts.

# Black Tie / Funeral
- Plain black suit
    - Super 100s worsted wool
        - Supposedly 120-160s is a good range for smart suits
            - https://www.montagio.com.au/cms/picking-the-perfect-suit-fabric-weave
        - Really depends on price
    - Plain weave

    Jacket:
    - Single breasted
    - Two button
    - Double vent
    - Flap pockets
    - Notched lapel
    - Probably a natural/neutral button stance
        - Has the top button sit at the thinnest part of the waist
        - Pretty much at the belly button
    - Ideally dark, rayon (Bemberg silk) lining
    - Ideally functional buttons

    Shirt:
    - White poplin cotton shirt
    - Most likely a spread collar but depends on the proportion of the suit

    Trousers:
    - Plain, matching jacket
    - Half break

    Shoes:
    - Ideally, black plain fronted whole-cut oxford
    - Less detailing the better
        - https://www.crockettandjones.com/collections/mens/oxfords/alex-black-calf/

    - The more flexible alternative is a black toe-cap oxford
        - Just a smidge less formal, more suitable for interviews
        - No broguing though

    - I'm tending towards the latter but I can afford to wait a little longer to get a bit more insight into things to come

    Tie:
    - Black silk tie

# Interviews / Weddings
- The suit for anything thats doesn't require the most formal outfit I own

- Dark navy suit
    Jacket
    - As above
    - Either a plain weave or a simple textured weave that appears solid across a room
        - e.g. birdseye, houndstooth, pin and pull (?)

    Shirt:
    - White twill shirt
        - Nice to introduce a little pattern in
        - Most job interviews will be for more casual places so need to dress up but not customer facing
    - The white poplin would also be fine
    - Probably spread collar

    Shoes:
    - Black toe cap oxford
        - Good interview shoe
        - So ubiquitous that they don't say anything at all

    - Dark brown derby
        - Already less formal so avoid brouging again
        - Good wedding shoe
        - Ideally rubber soled so that I don't have to worry about falling over on the dance floor at the after party

    Trousers:
    - As above

    Belt:
    - Either black or brown, ideally matching the shoes
    - Silver/steel metal

    Watch:
    - Dress
        - Rectangular
        - Steel
        - Thin enough to slip under a shirt cuff
        - Ideally mechanical or automatic

        - Orient Bambino
        - Junghans Max Bill
        - Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso
        - I have no intention of buying this watch anytime soon

    - Quartz
        - A fancy dress or sports watch attempts to communicate success
        - When I graduate I will be applying to graduate positions so this just comes across as presumptuous or possibly foolish
        - The image I will be trying to communicate is of efficient professionalism
        - A simple metal quartz watch such as the Casio A158W seems much more in line with this presentation
            - It helps that it reads as a bit nerdy as well
        - For higher level positions it makes more sense to have a fancier sports watch

# Smart Casual
- 

- Sports
    - Blue or black dial
    - Round
    - Steel
    - Ideally automatic
    - 100m+ water resistance

    - Casio Edifice

        - Casio A158W/A168W

    - Adventure watch
        - Old Casio Pro Trek (maybe a PAG240T-7)
        - Only downside is it's bigger than you'd want to wear when in normal situations

        - Casio G-Shock watches are probably the next best thing

        - Sometimes I need a jacket that can take half hearted attacks by large animals
        - I bought a !Solid leather jacket several years ago
        - I bought a size larger so I could layer some softer clothes underneath and it serves this function very well
        - Its grown up into a very tough and reliable leather jacket

Suit 
    - If I am wearing a suit it is for a very specific purpose: either a wedding, funeral or interview
    - I'm not interested in taking any risks with my suit

    - In all cases:
        - Two button, single breasted, flap pockets, plain trousers, double vent, notched lapel
        - Ideally wool, working buttons, rayon (Bemberg silk) lining
        - Probably matching lining
        - Tailored -> Classic/Regular fit

        - Some simple plain or twill weave seems to be the standard
        - Very formal
        - Funerals

    - Dark Navy
        - Ideally a birdseye weave or something else with a little more texture
            - Avoid hopsack on trousers

    - Marks & Spencers, Hackett, Oliver Brown, Husbands

Jumpers
    - I prefer v-necks for shirts and crew neck for t-shirts
    - Ideally high quality wool (merino, cashmere) but considering its mostly for layering cotton is fine

    - Two v-neck
        - The colours are difficult here
        - Might actually be possible to just have v-neck jumpers so long as the neck isn't too deep

    - Two crew neck
        - Light grey and black 

    - Half zip
        - Dark navy
        - Step up in warmth from v-neck/crew neck in terms of warmth

Shirts
    - White poplin smart shirt
        - For my purposes one is enough

    - Three oxford cloth button downs
        - Too much of a meme not to try it
        - White, sky blue and a pale pink/salmon

        - Preferably soft collar rather than fused
        - Box pleat down the back for movement

        - Charles Tyrwhitt, TM Lewin, PINK Shirtmakers, Brooks brothers (absurd prices)

    - Two summer shirts
        - Oxford cloth is a bit heavier weight than ideal
        - I tend to run a bit hot

        - Both long sleeve
        - Linen / Seersucker shirts in relaxed colours
        
        - The classics are:
            - White linen
            - Blue and white striped seersucker

        - I grabbed both of these from John Lewis at steep discounts
        - They are both great in different ways.
            - If I'm stuck at a desk the seersucker seems to do a good job of absorbing sweat and keeping me comfortable
            - If I'm moving about the wind filters through the linen and seems somehow cooler than it should 

    - Two winter shirts
        - Ideally wool, flannel plaid shirts
            - Personally I like the 
        - Double up as an overshirt in autumn
        - Turns out that wool flannel shirts are very hard to find. Will be keeping an eye out for these.

    - Ideally supima cotton
        - You pay 2-3x as much for knowing the cotton but considering plain t-shirts retail at around £5 its not the worst
