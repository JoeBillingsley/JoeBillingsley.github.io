- At riding schools they teach you to think in terms of 'energy'
- Build energy in the horse to get them to go faster with a good kick or two
- Spend energy by moving them in tight circles (about as close as a horse gets to jogging on the spot) in an over excited horse if they are too excited or nervous
- This never really quite stuck 

- Liking you doesn't mean that a horse won't bolt, liking you only determines if they'll throw you off first

- So far as I can tell, you can communicate with a horse in two main ways. You can try and talk horse and keep a careful eye on you're body language and on theirs.
- Reinforcement learning is an intermediate language that both horse and human can understand. 
- It's a mistake to think that the horse is thinking like you are. We share all the important bits for sure. They seem to feel excited, fearful, content, and most surprisingly sympathy. Without the haze of higher level brain functions horses can stare straight into your heart and see how you feel. A hug from a horse is a wonderful thing. 


- I *think* a part of this disconnect is that most riders ride intuitively, from years of experience starting from a very young age. Just as I did not think about grammar as I was writing this and probably neither did you as you read it 

('firmness', consistency, thinking in terms of applying pressure)
Lesson 1: If you kick it, it moves

- When I started riding I was taught, or at least I took away from the lessons, that the art of horse riding is in the precise application of force. Either 1) tighten the reins 2) kick harder or 3) apply a few thwacks from a whip.

- If you're interested in dressage then perhaps this is fine. But honestly, if someone hands you the reins to an animal that can run at 30+ miles per hours and jump metres at a time and the best idea you can come up with is to trot around in circles for half an hour... I'd say that you were severely lacking in imagination but I don't think you'd be able to conceive of the idea.

Lesson 2: If you kick it, it won't always move how you want to

There's only so much you can learn with 30 minutes practice a week and as a perpetual student for the last 6-ish years (BSc and now a PhD) that's all the horse riding I have typically been able to afford. To make up for it, I've worked in all sorts of places in return for food, accomodation and usually lessons on a horse or two. So far that's taken me to a camel riding school in Austria, a sheep farm in Ireland, a dog sledding tourist attraction thing just south of the arctic circle and most recently back to Ireland to an old stud farm.

This last farm was in the south of Ireland, in a little vilage with two pubs which best as I could tell the locals (or just everyone really, there's only locals here) alternated between such that each night one would be empty and the other rammmed. The farm had been handed down father to son for generations and seems to have been built with horses in mind. The main house looked out onto a central courtyard and faced a large metal barn that housed some foals and later some calfs (calves?) after we moved some fencing about. On the other sides of the square was the bungalow I was staying in and opposite that a long row of ~12 stables that stretched out to another cow shed, an arena (for riding horses in, not fighting them) and some more fields for the horses. A large glass window in the bungalow let the cold in and allowed a few of the horses a perfect view into the living room so that I spent every morning eating weetabix being stared down by whilst three hungry horses, trying to collectively will me into making *their* breakfast.

As luck would have it, it was one of these three horses that I ended up riding every day. It's worth pointing out that the family that owned the farm weren't your typical group of riders with a couple of all Ireland competitions wins along with a healthy number of races under their collective belt. As a result this horse had only ever been ridden by a few very talented riders - and then he met me. He did not take this very well.

He had no name when we met so I named him 'horse' on account of his species but you wouldn't know this if you saw us out together as I usually ended up calling him a hundred different unpleasent things as I lay on the grass he'd pitched me on to. That happened quite a bit. Horse wasn't a bad guy, in his stable or being led he was kind and easy going and he'd usually give me a sympathetic look after throwing me on the ground before he trotted off to find something to eat - but he was very different to what I was used to. He had been very well trained and was always listening attentively for subtle movements I didn't really understand yet: the weight in the saddle, the direction of the riders head, the angle and position of the reins and most importantly the pressure of the bit in his mouth. For a horse that was used to hearing all these subtle hints, I was a mad man screaming gibberish.
<!-- Understandably he'd get confused and eventually as he tried desperately to work out *what this mad man wants* I'd slip off.  -->

Over time, me and horse did get along better. He became more tolerant of . In return I worked on my hands everytime we rode trying to ensure I kept a comfortable, light and constant pressure on his mouth. 

As I brought my foot over into the saddle I nudged him forward just a step so that I ended up sitting just behind the saddle, with one foot still in the stirrups. Horse was very insistent that I *was in the wrong place* and helpfully freaked out, bucking and spinning about the yard. If you find yourself in a position like this the only decision you can make is where and how you will land. In this case, horse made that decision for me after he eventually bounced me out of the stirrup completely and brought me crashing down head first onto the stone below. Fortunately I had a helmet on else there may still be bits of me in that yard today. As is, I walked away a bit battered, bruised and a little concussed and done for the day.

About half an hour later once I could start thinking more clearly and my head ache was more manageable, I went out and took him out into the arena determined to get back on the horse and go for some kind of ride. Somehow - and I have honestly no memory of it, probably on account of the aforementioned concussion - I ended up on the floor again. Around this point I must have lost my cool because the next thing I remember I'm making him run, lap after lap around the arena - and fast too. We must have been at this for 10 minutes or more and by the time I had my composure back and let him stop breath was bellowing out of his wide nostrils and he was glistening with sweat despite the cold January weather. His ears were pricked and turned to on me. His eyes, despite being on the side of his head, were clearly staring straight at me. Every part of his body from the tip of nose to the end of his tail was saying one thing alone, *I am listening to you*. 

I approached him slowly, my body twisted a little a way from him, expecting him to turn and run or maybe aim a hoof at me but he stood calmly as I grabbed his bridle and he followed me out without any trouble as he cooled off with a walk around the yard and into his stable. I suspect that he would have kept just as close behind even without a bridle tethering us together.

That event marked a sea change in mine and Horse's relationship. From that point on till the end of the trip he never once managed to get me on the ground. He was much calmer now for one thing, but more than that it felt like he was looking out for me now in a way he wasn't before. It always felt remarkably stable and safe when we were out exploring together - even when we were doing something stupid like cantering down gallops. But at the time I didn't understand why. Why was he acting much more kind after I was rather unkind?

(Listening, mindfullness)
Lesson 3: You probably don't need to kick your horse
In certain circles, usually the kind with lots of hippies and drums, they say that horses can read minds. This is complete nonsense but absolutely true.

After Ireland I started a PhD in the south west of England where I quickly found another lesson stable and was soon plodding unsatisfactorily around in circles again \footnote{Well that's not entirely fair. There were some good teachers and horses at this stables and I did do some fun and challenging bits of jumping and some more complex dressage bits and pieces here and there, but there was a constant rotation of teachers so you never knew whether you'd end up doing something useful or just the same unimaginative exercises again}. After Ireland this was not satisfactory. 

The south west is known for being a bit posh and there's plenty of horses around. For whatever reason a lot of these people were buying more horses than they can actually keep exercised, so despite feeling totally unprepared for it, I wrote up a convincing, if a bit generous Horsey CV and posted it on all of the local facebook pages asking if anyone was in need of a rider. There were 3 replies. One stopped talking to me after a few messages. Another stopped talking to me after I'd cycled an hour and a half to their postcode and not found a house. The third reply was a hit and things worked out more or less perfectly. I ended up riding a lovely gray mare named Isca, staying about 40 minutes from my office, twice a week, every week for about a year and half.

It's only when you get to be about horses for this long that you can appreciate how unusually perceptive they are. The horse will always know if you have a carrot hiding in your back pocket. They can always tell if you're angry, anxious or content. After enough time working together, it seemed like Isca could read my mind at times and would do something before I explictly asked. At least, she would as long as the thought was 'faster' and the direction was home. 

The unusual corollary to this is that, despite all evidence to the contrary, horses seem to expect us to be as perceptive as they are. A horse will tell you a hundred times they're are anxious before they turn about and make a run for home. The horse has no sympathy for the fact most of these signs were little twitches around the eye and nose, a little flare in the nostrils or a few short breaths. It's your fault if you were not listening - and I say this as someone who as been on several a bolting horse. It was only relatively recently that I realised this, and several things started to fall into place.

Lesson 4: You probably shouldn't kick your horse
## The important bit





Isca eventually got sold and is now ridden by a young kid at the stable. She always seemed to like kids more than adults so I expect she is very happy with this new arrangement. Then came a horse called Tango, who could be a bit fizzy and once kicked me in the chest but he was a kind horse too and he taught me a few things but now he's being ridden by someone who is paying to do it and my work is piling up so I am horseless for the time being.
