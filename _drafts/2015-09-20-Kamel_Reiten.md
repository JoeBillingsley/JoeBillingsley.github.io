In the first week before Gerda arrived it was difficult to find things to do in my free time. Camel poo does not have the right consistency for ball games, it can survive a good hit but refuses to bounce, and I had not thought to bring anything with me. There is a TV but it seemed silly to travel so far just to watch BBC1. Most afternoons I would follow the horses out into the deer park and rest and read. There were good books in my room left behind by other helpers and Heidi, Gerda's sister, had a large collection of English books which she lent me use of.

	I'd recommend Perido Street Station if you can find it. I left it in the room with the TV when I went.

There are good footpaths I never took full advantage of that lead over and around some great hills. To your left when you first leave the gates there is a footpath that winds along the factory before heading off up the hill. If you stay with Gerda for a while you will likely help walk the camels along this footpath and through one of the gates that joins back into the deer park. This footpath will take you all the way to Melk if you stay on long enough. I suspect, but never confirmed, that there if you keep your eyes open on the way you will find a village with a guesthouse where you can stop for beer and cake.

The location is also unconventional. The stables sits on a site containing an elastic factory, a massive deer park and two houses containing 

At the heart of the complex is an elastic factory that produces belts, .

It is a musical place though it was never designed to be. 
Hungry camels and horses brayed out impatiently at me as I rushed around trying to get everyones food ready as quick as you can.  Somewhere a cutting blade keeps the beat.

If the factory is the heart of the complex the camels are the soul. The natural, off beat braying of impatient camels and horses contrasts with the regular _ of the cutting blade. 

At my count there were some 40 animals living at the school either in the stables or in the deer park including 6 camels

A stay with Gerda is a crash course in managing animals. The camels

	To be specific there were 3 dromedaries (1 hump) and 3 bactrians (2 humps).

In the last few days before I left I was completing all the tasks alone. It was hard work; it is alot to do by yourself but it felt good to be able to manage the place without help. When I had started I'd known nothing and when I left I could do it all.
