        - Current task, plan and current task notes?

        - Where does travel posts fit into this?
        - Projects: beer, PhD, metaheuristics, goals?
    - Maybe better to split by series/projects/posts
        - Series: Taught material. PhD or metaheuristics. Actually have some value to others. Promotional material. Case studies?
        - Projects: Goals that I need help with. Hope to get back some of the value given out in the series's.
