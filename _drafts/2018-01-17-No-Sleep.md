Jordan couldn't sleep.

There was no good reason for it, there never is. He tried sleeping on one side, then rolled to the other of his big empty bed. He flipped the pillows. He fluffed the pillows. He threw the pillows across the room. He stomped over to the bathroom. Poured himself a glass of water and went for a wee. He flopped back onto the bed. He tucked the blanket under his chin and tried to pull the other side up but one shoulder was frustratingly exposed. It pulled the blanket over and tucked it in.

Jordan couldn't sleep.
