Day 0
I'm writing this at about 20 to midnight. I ate my last meal just under 5 hours ago and if all goes to plan I won't eat another meal for about 5 days. This isn't the first time I've tried a fast but it will be the longest so far. Usually I'd be feeling fairly confident at the moment but unfortunately I made the mistake of telling people I was planning on doing it and so now I've locked myself in. The next 8 hours should be easy, after that things get more interesting.

Day 1
This morning I had a multivitamin for breakfast, water for lunch and it'll be sleep for dinner. So far I've been fairly consistently hungry with the occasional pang that anyone who's ever skipped a meal will be familiar with. But whilst they always seems persistent at first the pangs go away after about an hour or so and it's tolerable after that. Really the worse thing is the persistent nagging desire to eat and when that's not satisfied to move or work or do something - anything. It's a quiet voice at the moment but insistent.

There are some beneficial points that I had forgotten about. Usually after a days work I'd be pretty tired, at least mentally and my body would usually follow suit. After not eating anything for over 24 hours I've got a lot more energy available all round. The extra energy is making it easier to plow on with other tasks I've been putting off. Admittedly I am getting distracted fairly easily but it is hard to say if it is any worse than usual.
