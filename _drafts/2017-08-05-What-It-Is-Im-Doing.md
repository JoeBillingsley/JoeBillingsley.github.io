# What it is I'm doing

My thesis has a pretty scary title:

## Dynamic Resource Management and Optimisation for SLA Guarantees in Hyperconverged Communication Infrastructures

So people have usually switched off by halfway and then politely smile and make a motion to say it's all gone right over their head. It's a blunt instrument like that but it can be pretty useful if your just trying to impress someone who's not familiar with the area.

The thing is there's actually some very simple ideas in there that anyone can understand but there's a load of jargon getting in the way. I believe research should be open and written in plain English so over the course of my PhD I plan to try and explain what I'm working on so that anyone could understand it, because the more people we have thinking about the big problems the better. 

What follows is a long, silly but comprehensive analogy. Or there's a TL;DR version at the bottom which just explains the key ideas.

So.

Imagine your were tasked with managing a library. It doesn't matter so much what it looks like just yet as long as it's small to start with.

Your responsibility is to make sure that everyone can find the information they are after as with as little hassle as possible. Now when you started working at the library it was fairly specialist if a bit weird. There was one section dedicated to childrens fiction, another for foreign language dictionaries and a small section for philosophy. 

But people liked the library. You kept it clean and organised as best you could and more and more people started visiting every day. To cope with the increased demand the library was extended and expanded and over time the library got bigger, and bigger and bigger till we get to today where there's a section for every modern and ancient language, philosophy has moved to it's own wing filled with smoking hipster and the childrens books live in a tower with 100 different colours and a slide around the outside. That cute little library you started working in has become an architectual nightmare.

More people keep coming and wanting more and more from your library. It seems like every day another building is added to try and meet demand and it's only going to get worse - you've just been told to expect a 1000x more people in the next 4 years. And if that wasn't bad enough your running out of space too so you can't just keep building extensions like you'd managed to so far. But that wasn't going to work anymore anyway. The electricity bill is already enormous since you have to keep all the lights running in a building anytime anyone is in it. That's without even mentioning the impact it's having on the environment!

It's 5:40 AM and your worries won't let you rest. You slump in your seat, drop your head against the reception desk and groan gently and wish for sleep.

The service bell rings right next to your ear.

*Ba DING*

You look up to see a man with a long grey beard dressed in a long cape and a pointy hat with a bag slung over his shoulder.

He opens his mouth to speak.

'Role Playing Game rules books are in the east wing, floor 4. Harry Potter is down that corridor to the fantasy building. Contemporary Witchcraft is out in the yard. The black pointy one shaped like a hat.' you say and drop your head against the desk again. 

**Thud**

Silence, then

*Ba DING*

He's still there.

'What.' you say.

'I'm a salesman' he says, 'I've travelled all around this land acquiring items of interest and I have just what you need'

'Uh huh' you say as you slowly reach under the table to the panic button.

'WAIT!' he says. 

'Well he's a perceptive nutter' you think.

'Let me show you' and he drops the bag onto the reception desk where it collapses softly. He pats the bag down gently. 'See? It's empty'.

He puts his arm into the bag and pulls out a copy of 'Anthology of Appropriate Analogies, Volume 1'. And then takes out Volume 2 and stacks it on top. And Volume 3. And his arms are shaking as he tries to raise Volume 4 to the top of the stack which stands at nearly 1/2 metre tall now.

To say the least your surprised.

'How...' you whisper.

'How much?' he says with a smirk, 'For you I'll settle for directions. Which way to mathematical optimisation?'

'...um', you can't take your eyes off the bag but you've never been one to lose their cool for long, 'Up the hill and you'll be close enough to see it'.

He turns on his heel and strides away.

-

You pace back and forwards eyes locked firmly on the bag. Surrounding you are books of all shapes and sizes. It's nearly 6AM, a quiet time in the library.

On the desk is a list with your observations about the bag so far:

1. Any book in the library can be pulled from the bag 
2. Any book placed in the bag disappears

How does this solve my problems? It's not getting the books that's the problem it's the storing of them so everyone can read them. A thought stops you in your tracks.

You run to the bag, reach in and pull out 'Ingots of Gold: A Miss Marple short story'. You throw the book to the side and collapse back in your seat. With a sigh you add:

3. The bag can only produce books

The clock strikes 6. 'The barrista's will be here soon' you muse 'Coffee moves so fast these days. Then the doctors and nurses. Then the engineers. Some kids before school and then again after they finish and it'll really get busy once everyone finishes work...'

Then it hits you.

You don't have to have enough space for all of the books everyone will need. You only need enough space for the books they need at a given time! If you can work out what books people will need at different times of the day then you can just get those books out of the bag and on the shelf when they're required. In fact, if you put all the books on the shelves into the bag then you can put the books out into the buildings closest to the door first. That way you can turn off the lights in the buildings that aren't being used and save money and energy aswell. 

But you'll need to be able to move pretty quickly to do that. And you'll need a good understanding of what books are going to be needed at a given time in advance. Otherwise you'll be running around putting books on shelves all day. Perhaps the wizard could help here again...

Armed with a pair of shoes that let you move at light speed you begin to draw up a plan.

Now this! Is a hard problem...
