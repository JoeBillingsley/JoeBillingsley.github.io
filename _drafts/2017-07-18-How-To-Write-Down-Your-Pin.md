Around the start of this year I was in a pub a few pints down and had just ordered another one. I'd burnt through all my cash for the evening already but sober Joe had taken the debit card out. Typically muscle memory would kick in at this point and enter my pin - that evening it did not and after thinking about it for a while I confused myself so much it took two weeks to remember it. 

Now if I'd had my pin written down somewhere this wouldn't have been a problem but that would mean writing down a rather important number where anyone could find it.

I was thinking about this recently and I've come up with a couple of easy ways you can write down important numbers whilst still keeping them a secret.

### 1. 
Very simple. The first digit tells you what number to remove and then whatevers left is your secret number.

Say you had a 4 digit PIN number you wanted to remember. First think of a number from 1 to 5 and write it down. 

Then write down all of the numbers of your PIN up to the number you thought of. 

Write down a random number from 1 - 9 and then write the rest of your PIN.

Simple. To get your pin back just mentally cross of the first number and the number it is pointing at and your there.

This works so long as you don't need to write down for than 9 digits. For numbers longer than that you just can use the first two digits. So 13242... would mean remove the 13th number.

This technique is more complicated but lets you pad your secret with as many digits as you want. It also requires a bit more planning so perhaps work out the number on a piece of scrap paper first then burn it/eat it/destroy it.

With this approach each number you cross off tells you which number to cross off next till you reach a zero.

Think of as many numbers from 1 - 9 as you want. Doesn't matter how many so long as they sum together to less than the number of digits of your secret. Now write down the first number. 

Then write down that number of digits of your secret. 

Write down your next number and do the same. 

When you get to your last number, write out that number of digits and then write a zero.

Then write the remaining numbers of the secret.

Definitely more complicated than the first technique but more flexible too and you can hide your secret amongst as many numbers as you want.

Anyway, I hope these will be useful for anyone else who occasionally struggles to remember 4 digit numbers.
