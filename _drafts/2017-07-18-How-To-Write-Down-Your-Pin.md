Around the start of this year I was in a pub a few pints down and had just ordered another one. I'd burnt through all my cash for the evening already but sober Joe had taken the debit card out. Muscle memory.

Eventually I was able to 

I was thinking about this problem recently and I've come up with a couple of easy ways you can write down these important numbers whilst still keeping them a secret.

### 1. 
Say you had a 4 digit PIN number you wanted to remember. First think of a number from 1 to 5. Write that number down first. Then write down all of the numbers of your PIN up to the number you thought of. Write down a random number from 1 - 9 and then write the rest of your PIN.

When you want to get your number back look at the first number 

This way works best for numbers that are 9 digits long or less unless you remember that you have to read two digits when your finding the number to remove.

### 2.
This technique is more complicated but lets you pad your secret with as many digits as you want. It also requires a bit of planning so perhaps work out the number on a piece of scrap paper first then burn it/eat it/whatever your method of choice.

Think of a bunch of numbers from 1 - 9, it doesn't matter how many but they have to add together to less than the number of digits of your secret. Now write down the first number. Then write down the number of digits of your secret that your number is. Write down your next number and do the same. When you get to your last number, write out the numbers of your secret and then write a zero. Write the remaining numbers of the secret.

The first digit tells you which number to remove. The value of this digit tells you the next number you need to remove
