Crossing the road in Vietnam is like walking through a flock of birds. 

The sky cracked open and rain poured out. When the lightning struck it sounded like concrete snapping, like a building being broken clean in half.

A gecko crawled up the wall. 

We'd missed the flights and now I had the shits. Only then did I realise how much I was looking forward to getting back. I'd really enjoyed the trip and there was a lot I was leaving behind but I missed a lot of home too. I missed safe roads, cheddar, good Indian curry, wearing jumpers, crappy TV and poo's that didn't come out like herbal tea. I missed cold air and the way your breath frosts on cold nights. I missed home and my family.
To be a tourist is to go somewhere to see something you know is there but to travel is to go somewhere and see what you might find.
