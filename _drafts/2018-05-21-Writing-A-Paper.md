Recently I submitted a paper to my first international conference. I thought that writing the paper would be easy, seeing as all of the 'actual' work was done already.

It took 16 drafts over 6 weeks to get something that my supervisors were happy with.

That's not because my supervisors were being unnecessarily harsh or perfectionist, the first draft was actually a bit crap and could still now be improved. From the experience I've learnt there are at least four things a good paper must be:

1. Logical
2. Accurate
3. Precise
4. Entertaining

Now keep in mind when reading this that I've written *one paper* and am very far from being an expert in it. Unfortunately though for most experienced academics I meet, writing good paper comes so naturally to them that they struggle to convey what it actually is that they are doing. These notes are an attempt to make plain the criteria that they follow. 

## Logical

Science is a process of examining a problem, working through it logically, comprehensively examining and following the available evidence to come to a reliable conclusion. A research paper is meant to be a demonstration that you have followed this process and that your conclusions are therefore justified.

The typical structure of a research paper falls out naturally from this. Every step must logically follow from the previous one. The root of this is your introduction which connects your research with the rest of the world. Every subsequent paragraph answers some question that was implicitly raised in the previous one:

Introduction
- What problem are you trying to solve?
- Why is it worth solving?
- Have others attempted this?

Literature Review
- What were their results/approaches?
- What hasn't been tested/tried?
- How does your work fit in?

...and so on.

This isn't unlike how you might structure any piece of writing but the difference with a scientific paper is the rigour that is required. A break in the logic or otherwise some unanswered question implies you might not have fully considered all of the evidence and damages your conclusions.

## Accurate

There are only three things you can include in a scientific paper:

1. Tautologies, things that are true by definition or otherwise bloody obvious
2. Things that were proven in some other work that you reference
3. Things that you prove in your paper

Anything else is suspect, perhaps even dangerous since others may reference your assumptions as if they were facts. If we (intentionally or not) allow false statements in the paper then no one can trust the conclusions.

I found rule 1 to be particularly problematic. A couple of times when writing the paper I made some statements that seemed obviously true from the reading I had done elsewhere. For example that the rise in demand for cloud computing had led to increased energy consumption by datacentres. Everything I'd read gave me the impression this must be true. And it is, but with important details that were not obvious till someone sat down and actually did the research.

## Precise

Suitably precise data and figures are obviously necessary since people are going to be making conclusions from them. What tripped me up more was the precision required in the wording. 

When I write, I naturally use a lot of adverbs but they're often difficult to quantify. How good is 'much more effective'? How frequent is 'quite often'? While imprecise statements might not be outright false they are open to interpretation and this can weaken the papers conclusions.

Precise language leaves no doubt. Rather than 'much more effective' you could say that something is '2.5x more effective on average...'. Of course you then need to ensure there is no doubt what 'better' and 'average' mean in the context...

## Entertaining

This is one aspect that I could have definitely improved upon in my paper. The very best papers I read have some extra magic that makes them really enjoyable to read. I've not managed to work out exactly what the secret ingredients are but there are a few I've picked up on:

### Beautiful 
Pretty papers are nicer to read. A healthy mix of figures, text and tables looks much less intimidating than a wall of text on a first glance and it keeps things interesting throughout.

### Expressive
Expressive language is allowed so long as it remains precise. Emotive language when introducing the problem can give the paper a bit of go, pulling you into the paper and carrying you through the tricky bits. There is a balance to strike here though as most papers are written for an international audience. My rule at the moment is to use simple language for the hard parts of the paper.

### Short
No one likes to waste their time. The best papers I've read can flip your perspective in a few good pages of text and some well placed figures. A short, insightful paper is a joy to read.

No doubt, a big part of writing a good paper is practice.
